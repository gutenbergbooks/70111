<p class="drop-cap">IN the reproduction of this quaint and curious
treatise, which is one of the earliest, on the
<em>Natural History of New England</em>, it has
been the intention of the Publisher to enhance
its value as a literary curiosity, by making it as
nearly as possible an exact Fac-simile of the original
edition, in accordance with the projected plan of a series
of reprints, in which the present work is comprised.</p>

<p>In the furtherance of this intention, the precise orthography,
punctuation, and also the arrangement,—with the
exception of the commencement and termination of pages,—have
been preserved.</p>

<p>The valuable Introduction and Notes of Prof. <span class="smcap">Tuckerman</span>,
incorporated in this edition, have been previously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
issued in vol. iv. of “The Transactions of the American
Antiquarian Society,” which contains a reprint of “The
Rarities” in a more modern style. The notes have, however,
undergone a thorough revision by the author; and
some few additions have been made by him, during the
progress of the present edition through the press.</p>

<p>Some additional matter concerning the Genealogy of
the Josselyn Family may be found contained in the Preface
of the “Two Voyages to New England in 1638 and 1663,
by John Josselyn,” published in uniform style with the
present work.</p>

<p class="drop-capx">MR. John Josselyn, the writer of
this book, was only brother, as he says,
to Henry Josselyn, Esq., many years of
Black Point in Scarborough, Me.; and
both were sons to Sir Thomas Josselyn,
Knt., of Kent, whose name is at the
head of the new charter obtained by Sir Ferdinando
Gorges for his Province in 1639, but who did not come
to this country. Mr. Henry Josselyn was at Piscataqua,
in the interest of Capt. John Mason, at least as early as
1634; but, in 1636, he is one of the Council of Gorges’s
Province in Maine, and continued in that part of the
country the rest of his life. He succeeded in 1643, by
the will of Capt. Thomas Cammock, to his patent at
Black Point, and soon after married his widow. He
is afterwards Deputy-Governor of the Province; and
until 1676, when the Indians attacked and compelled him
to surrender his fort, he was, says Mr. Willis,—whose
valuable papers are cited below,—“one of the most active<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
and influential men in it;” holding, “during all the
changes of proprietorship and government, the most important
offices.” He is then a magistrate of the Duke of
York’s Province of Cornwall, and, as late as 1680, a resident
of Pemaquid; when he is spoken of, in a letter of
Gov. Andros to the commander of the fort at Pemaquid,
as one “whom I would have you use with all fitting
respect, considering what he hath been and his age.” He
is living in 1682; but had died before the 10th of May,
1683,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
leaving no descendants.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the evidence, above afforded, of the
social position of the family of which Henry and John
Josselyn were members, the present writer failed in
tracing it, doubtless from not knowing in which county
it had its principal seat. In this uncertainty, it occurred
to him to make application to the eminent English antiquary,—the
Rev. Joseph Hunter, Vice-President of
the Society of Antiquaries of London,—to whom he
was indebted for former kind attentions; and was
favored by this gentleman with such directions as left
nothing to be desired. “The Josslines,” writes Mr.
Hunter “(the name is written in some variety of orthographies,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
and now more usually Joceline), are quite one
of the old aristocratic families of England, having several
knights in the early generations; being admitted
into the order of baronets, and subsequently into the
peerage.... Their main settlement was in Hertfordshire,
at or near the town of Sabridgeworth; and accounts
of them may be read in the histories—of which
Chauncy’s, Salmon’s, and Clutterbuck’s are the chief—of
that county. But a fuller and better account is to
be found in the ‘Peerage of Ireland,’ by Mr. Lodge,
keeper of the records in the Birmingham Tower, Dublin:
4 vols. 8vo, 1754.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>According to Lodge, the family begins with a Sir
Egidius, who passed into England in the time of Edward
the Confessor, and was descended from “Carolus
Magnus, King of France, with more certainty than the
houses of Lorraine and Guise.” Of this Sir Egidius was
Sir Gilbert de Jocelyn, who accompanied the Conqueror,
and had Gilbert—called St. Gilbert, being canonized by
Pope Innocent III. in 1202—and Geoffry. To this Geoffry
is traced back John Jocelyn, living in 1226; who married
Catherine, second daughter and co-heir to Sir Thomas
Battell, and had Thomas, who married Maud, daughter
and co-heiress of Sir John Hide, of Hide Hall in Sabridgeworth,
county of Hertford, Knt., by his wife Elizabeth,
daughter of John Sudeley; Baron Sudeley, in the
county of Gloucester. He had Thomas Jocelyn, Esq., who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
married Joan, daughter of John Blunt, and had Ralph,
who married Maud, daughter of Sir John Sutton <em>alias</em>
Dudley, and had Geoffry of Hide Hall, 1312. Geoffry
married Margaret, daughter of Robert Rokell or Rochill,
and had Ralph, who married Margaret, daughter and heir
to John Patmer, Esq., and had Geoffry (died 1425), who
married Catherine, daughter and heir to Sir Thomas Bray,
and had four sons and two daughters. Of these, the eldest
was Thomas Jocelyn, Esq., living in the reign of Edward
IV., who married Alice, daughter of Lewis Duke of
Dukes in Essex, Esq., by his wife Anne, daughter of John
Cotton, Esq., and had issue George, his heir, called Jocelyn
the Courtier, who married Maud, daughter and heir to
Edmond Bardolph,—Lord Bardolph,—and had one
daughter and three sons. John Jocelyn, Esq.,—“auditor
of the augmentations, upon the dissolution of the abbeys
by King Henry VIII.,”—was son and heir to the last-mentioned
George, and married Philippa, daughter of
William Bradbury, of Littlebury in Essex; by whom he
had Sir Thomas, of Hide Hall,—created a Knight of the
Bath at the coronation of King Edward VI.,—who married
Dorothy, daughter of Sir Geoffry Gales or Gates,
Knt., and had issue;<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> one daughter marrying Roger Harlakenden,
of Carnarthen in Kent, Esq.; and the fifth son
being Henry Jocelyn, Esq., who married Anne, daughter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
and heir to Humphrey Torrell, otherwise Tyrrell, of Torrell’s
Hall in Essex,—became seated there, and had six
sons and six daughters. The second son of this family was
Sir Thomas Jocelyn (father to our author), who was twice
married. His first wife was Dorothy, daughter of John
Frank, Esq.; by whom he had six sons and five daughters,—Torrell,
born 28th May, 1690; Henry, and Henry,
both died infants; Thomas, who died without issue, in
1635, at Bergen op Zoom; Edward, who, by a lady of
Georgia, had a daughter Dorothy, and died at Smyrna in
1648; Benjamin, born 19th May, 1602; Anne, married to
William Mildmay, Esq., by whom she had Robert, John,
Anne, and Elizabeth; Dorothy, married to John Brewster,
Esq., and left no issue; Elizabeth, married to Francis Neile,
Esq., and had Francis, John, and Mary; Frances, born
26th March, 1600, and married Rev. Clement Vincent;
and Mary, died unmarried. The second wife of Sir
Thomas Jocelyn was Theodora, daughter to Edmond
Cooke, of Mount Maschall in Kent, Esq.; and by her he
had Henry, John, Theodora, and Thomazine. Torrell, the
eldest son, married, first, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Richard
Brooke of Cheshire,—heir to her grandfather (by the
mother), Dr. Chaderton, Bishop of Lincoln,—by whom
he had a daughter, Theodora, married to Samuel Fortrie,
Esq.,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> to whom our author dedicates the present volume,
with acknowledgment of the “bounty” of his “honored
friend and kinsman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>The principal line of the family was continued by Richard,
heir to Sir Thomas of Hide Hall; the said Richard
being brother to our author, John Josselyn’s grandfather.
In 1665, Sir Robert Jocelyn of Hide Hall was advanced
to the dignity of baronet. The fifth son of this Sir Robert
was Thomas; whose son, Robert Jocelyn, Esq., was bred
to the law; was Solicitor-General and Attorney-General
and Lord High Chancellor of Ireland; and created, in
1743, Baron Newport of Newport, and Viscount Jocelyn
in 1755. Robert, son and successor of this nobleman, was
created, in 1771, Earl of Roden, of High Roding, County
of Tipperary; and was ancestor to the present Lord
Roden.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Our author, John Josselyn, made his first voyage to New
England in 1638; arriving in Boston Harbor the 3d of
July, and remaining with his brother at Black Point till the
10th of October of the following year. While at Boston,
he paid his respects to the Governor and to Mr. Cotton,
being the bearer to the latter of some poetical pieces from
the poet Quarles; and, as he says, “being civilly treated
by all I had occasion to converse with.” In the account
of his first voyage, there is no appearance of that dislike to
the Massachusetts government and people which is observable
in the narrative of the second, and may there not
unfairly be connected with his brother’s political and religious
differences with Massachusetts.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> His second voyage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
was made in 1663. He arrived at Nantasket the 27th of
July, and soon proceeded to his brother’s plantation, where
he tells us he staid eight years, and got together the matter
of the book before us. This was first printed in 1672, but
occurs also with later dates. It was followed, in 1674, by
“An Account of Two Voyages to New England; wherein
you have the Setting-out of a ship, with the Charges; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
Prices of all Necessaries for furnishing a Planter and his
Family at his first Coming; a Description of the Country,
Natives, and Creatures; the Government of the Countrey
as it is now possessed by the English, &amp;c. A large Chronological
Table of the most Remarkable Passages, from the
first Discovering of the Continent of America to the Year
1673.” 12mo, pp. 279. Reprinted in the third volume of
the Third Series of the Collections of the Historical Society;
which edition is quoted here. A large part of the
“Voyages” is taken up with observations relating to natural
history; and it is quite likely that the author tried in
this second work to supply some of the defects of his
“Rarities.” Compare especially the accounts of beasts of
the earth, of birds, and of fishes; each of which is better
done in the “Voyages.”</p>

<p>Josselyn was, it appears, a man of polite reading. He
quotes Lucan, Pliny, and Du Bartas; he has Latin and
Italian proverbs; he is acquainted with the writings of
Mr. Perkins, that famous divine; with Van Helmont;
with Sandys’s “Travels,” and Capt. John Smith’s. His
curiosity in picking up “excellent medecines” points to an
acquaintance with physic; of his practising which, there
occur, indeed (pp. 48, 58, 63), several instances.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Nor is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
he, by any means, uninterested in prescriptions for the
kitchen; as see his elaborate <em>recipe</em> for cooking eels
(Voyages, p. 111), and also that (<em>ibid.</em>, p. 190) for a compound
liquor “that exceeds <em>passada</em>, the Nectar of the
country;” which is made, he tells us, of “Syder, Maligo-Raisons,
Milk, and Syrup of Clove-Gilliflowers.” But his
curiosity in natural history, and especially in botany, is his
chief merit; and this now gives almost all the value that
is left to his books.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> William Wood, the author of
“New-England’s Prospect” (London, 1634<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>), was a better
observer, generally, than Josselyn; but the latter makes
up for his other short-comings by the particularity of his
botanical information.</p>

<p>The “Voyages” was Josselyn’s last appearance in print.
He was already advanced in years, and alludes to this at
page 69 of the present book, where he says he shall refer
the further investigation of a curious plant—of which a
neighbor, “wandering in the woods to find out his strayed
cattle,” had brought him a fragment—“to those that are
younger, and better able to undergo the pains and trouble
of finding it out.” “Henceforth,” he declares in his
“Voyages,” p. 151, “you are to expect no more Relations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
from me. I am now return’d into my Native Countrey;
and, by the providence of the Almighty and the bounty
of my Royal Soveraigness, am disposed to a holy quiet of
study and meditation for the good of my soul; and being
blessed with a transmentitation or change of mind, and
weaned from the world, may take up for my word, <i lang="la">non est
mortale quod opto</i>.”</p>

<p>We may suppose that a rude acquaintance with the
more common or important animals of a new country will
commence with the discovery of it. Thus the beginning
of European knowledge of the marine animals of America
goes back, doubtless, to the earliest fisheries of Newfoundland;
and these began almost immediately after the
discovery of the continent. Game and peltry were also
likely to come to the knowledge of the earliest adventurers;
and scattered among these, from the first, were
doubtless men capable of regarding the world of new
objects around them with an intelligent, if not a literate
eye. Descriptions in this way, and specimens, at length
reached Europe, and became known to the learned there—to
Gesner, Clusius, and Aldrovandus—from as early as
the middle of the sixteenth century. Without being
naturalists, such observers as Heriot in Virginia (1585-6)
and Wood in Massachusetts (1634) could give valuable
accounts of what they saw; and more, it may well be,
was due to the Christian missionaries, who accompanied or
followed the adventurers, for the conversion of the heathen.
Gabriel Sagard was one of these missionaries, a <i lang="fr">recollet</i> or
reformed Franciscan monk, who went from Paris to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
Canada in 1624, and spent two years in the country of the
Hurons; publishing his “<span lang="fr">Grand Voyage du Pays des Hurons</span>”
in 1632, and enlarging it in 1636 to “<span lang="fr">Histoire du
Canada et Voyages que les Freres Mineurs recollets y ont
faits pour la Conversion des Infidelles</span>,” &amp;c., in four books;
of which the third treats of natural history,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and is cited
by Messrs. Audubon and Bachmann (Vivip. Quadrupeds
of N.A., <i lang="la">passim</i>) for a good part of our more common
and noticeable <i lang="la">Mammalia</i>. Something considerable thus
got to be known of marine animals of all sorts, and of
quadrupeds. But it was much longer before our birds—if
we except a very few, as the blue-jay and the turkey—came
to the scientific knowledge of Europeans; and this
remark is, as might be expected, at least equally true of
our reptiles.</p>

<p>Quite as accidental, doubtless, was the beginning of
European acquaintance with our plants. There are, indeed,
traces of the knowledge of a few at a very early
period. Dalechamp, Clusius, Lobel, and Alpinus—all
authors of the sixteenth century—must be cited occasionally
in any complete synonymy of our <i>Flora</i>. The Indian-corn,
the side-saddle flower (<i>Sarracenia purpurea</i> and
<i>S. flava</i>), the columbine, the common milk-weed (<i>Asclepias
Cornuti</i>), the everlasting (<i>Antennaria margaritacea</i>),
and the <i>Arbor vitæ</i>, were known to the just-mentioned
botanists before 1600. <i>Sarracenia flava</i> was sent
either from Virginia, or possibly from some Spanish monk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
in Florida. Clusius’s figure of our well-known northern
<i>S. purpurea</i>—of which he gives, however, only the
leaves and base of the stem (<i>Clus. Hist. Pl.</i>, <em>cit.</em> Gerard <em>a</em>
Johnson)—was derived from a specimen furnished to him
by one Mr. Claude Gonier, apothecary at Paris, who himself
had it from Lisbon; whither we may suppose it was
carried by some fisherman from the Newfoundland coast.
The evening primrose (<i>Œnothera biennis</i>) was known in
Europe, according to Linnæus, as early as 1614. <i>Polygonum
sagittatum</i> and <i>arifolium</i> (tear-thumb) were figured
by De Laet, probably from New-York specimens, in his
“Novus Orbis,” 1633. Johnson’s edition of Gerard’s
“Herbal” (1636)—which was possibly our author’s manual
in the study of New-England plants—contains some
dozen North-American species, furnished often from the
garden of Mr. John Tradescant, who had other plants from
“Virginia” beside the elegant one which bears his name;
and John Parkinson—whose “Theatrum Botanicum”
(1640) is declared by Tournefort to embrace a larger
number of species than any work which had gone before
it—describes, especially from Cornuti, a still larger number.
But the first treatise especially concerned with
North-American plants was that of the French author just
mentioned; which, on several accounts, deserves particular
attention.</p>

<p>John Robin—“second to none,” says Tournefort, “in
the knowledge and cultivation of plants”—was placed
in charge of the Royal Botanical Garden at Paris, about
the year 1570; and Vespasian Robin, “a most diligent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
botanist,” followed, in similar connection<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> with the larger
garden founded by Lewis the Thirteenth. Both are said
to have assisted the writer whose book we are to notice;
but especially the latter,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> who, there is little doubt, deserves
credit for all the American species described in it.</p>

<p>The history of Canadian and other new plants—“<span lang="la">Canadensium
Plantarum, aliarumque nondum editarum Historia</span>”
of Jacobus Cornuti, Doctor of Medicine, of Paris—was
printed in that city (pp. 238) in 1635, under the
patronage just mentioned; and contains accounts, accompanied,
in every case but one, with figures on copper, of
thirty-seven of our plants; of which the meadow-rue is
known to botanists as <i>Thalictrum Cornuti</i>; and the common
milkweed, as <i>Asclepias Cornuti</i>. Though himself
not eminent as a botanist,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> the work of Cornuti was valuable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
for its elegant presentation of much that was new; and
it will always deserve honorable remembrance in the history
of our <i>Flora</i>. There are several passages of it—as
at pp. 5 and 7, and in the account of the two baneberries
at p. 76, where we read, “<span lang="la">Opacis et sylvestribus locis in
eadem Americæ parte frequentissimum est geminum genus</span>”—which
look a little like a proper botanical collector’s
notes on his specimens; and these specimens, and the
others from the same region, may well have been results
of the herborizing of that worthy Franciscan missionary,
whose early observations on the natural history of Canada
have been mentioned already above. Nor were the
North-American plants possessed by Cornuti entirely confined
to this region; for he speaks at the end (p. 214) of
his having received a root, <i>ex notha Anglia</i>, as he strangely
calls it, known, it appears, by the name of <i>Serpentaria</i>, or,
in the vernacular, <i>Snaqroel</i>,—a sure remedy for the bite
of a huge and most pernicious serpent <i>in notha Anglia</i>,—which
was no doubt the snake-root so famous once as a
cure for the bite of a rattlesnake, and one of the numerous
varieties of <i>Nabalus albus</i> (L.) Hook., if not, as Pursh
supposed, what is now the <i>var. Serpentaria</i>, Gray. But
some view of the scantiness of scientific knowledge of our
<i>Flora</i>, near forty years after Cornuti, may be had by reckoning
the number of species for which Bauhin’s “Pinax”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
and “Prodromus” (1671) are cited by Linnæus in the
“Species Plantarum.” Most of them are Southern plants;
and the few decidedly Northern ones which meet us—as
<i>Cornus canadensis</i>, <i>Uvularia perfoliata</i>, <i>Trillium erectum</i>,
<i>Arum triphyllum</i>, and <i>Adiantum pedatum</i>—are all indicated,
by Bauhin’s phrase, as from Brazil!</p>

<p>We have nothing illustrating the <i>Flora</i> of New England
from Cornuti till Josselyn. In Virginia, Mr. John Banister,
a correspondent of Ray’s, began to botanize probably not
long after the middle of the seventeenth century. He was
succeeded by several eminent names; as Mark Catesby,
F.R.S. (born 1679), John Clayton, Esq. (born 1685), and
John Mitchell, M.D., F.R.S.,—a contemporary of the
other two,—who together gave to the botany of Virginia
a distinguished lustre; as did Cadwalader Colden, Esq.
(born 1688),—a selection from whose correspondence has
been lately edited by Dr. Gray,—to that of New York;
John Bartram (born 1701), “American botanist to his
Britannic Majesty,” to that of Pennsylvania; and, somewhat
later, Alexander Garden, M.D., F.R.S. (born 1728),
to that of South Carolina. Josselyn himself is, indeed,
little more than a herbalist; but it is enough that he gets
beyond that entirely unscientific character. He certainly
botanized, and made botanical use of Gerard and his other
authorities. The credit belongs to him of indicating
several genera as new which were so, and peculiar to the
American <i>Flora</i>. It may at least be said, that, at the time
he wrote, there is no reason to suppose that any other
person knew as much as he did of the botany of New<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
England. “The plants in New England,” he says in his
“Voyages,” p. 59, “for the variety, number, beauty, and
virtues, may stand in competition with the plants of any
countrey in Europe. Johnson hath added to Gerard’s
‘Herbal’ three hundred, and Parkinson mentioneth many
more. Had they been in New England, they might have
found a thousand, at least, never heard of nor seen by any
Englishman before.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Nor did our author fail to adorn
his “Rarities” with recognizable figures, as well as descriptions,
of some of these new American plants; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
his arrangement is also creditable to his botanical knowledge.
By this arrangement, his collections are distinguished
into—</p>

<p class="noindent fs80">
1. “Such plants as are common with us in England.”<br>
2. “Such plants as are proper to the country.”<br>
3. “Such plants as are proper to the country, and have no name.”<br>
4. “Such plants as have sprung up since the English planted and kept cattle in New England.”<br>
</p>

<p>The last of these divisions is the most valuable part of
Josselyn’s account, as it affords the only testimony that
there is to the first notice among us of a number of now
naturalized weeds, which it is an interesting question to
separate from the more important class of plants truly
indigenous in, and common to, both hemispheres; and the
author’s treatment of the latter—as indeed of the other
two lists mentioned above—shows that he was competent,
in a measure, to reckon the former. This furnishes a date,
and an early one; and there is no other till 1785, when
Dr. Manasseh Cutler’s Memoir, to be spoken of, enables us
to limit the appearance of some other species not mentioned
by Josselyn.</p>

<p>There is no work of any size or importance on New-England
plants, after Josselyn, for the whole century which
followed. We were not, indeed, without men in distinguished
connection with the European scientific world.
The most eminent New-England family gained honors in
science, as well as in the conduct of affairs. John Winthrop
the younger, eldest son of the first Governor of
Massachusetts,—and the “heir,” says Savage, “of all his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
father’s talents, prudence, and virtues, with a superior
share of human learning,”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>—was himself the first Governor
of Connecticut, and had, in this connection, a certain
scientific position and reputation. “The great Mr.
Boyle, Bishop Wilkins, with several other learned men,”
says Dr. Eliot, “had proposed to leave England, and establish
a society for promoting natural knowledge in the new
colony of which Mr. Winthrop, their intimate friend and
associate, was appointed Governor. Such men were too
valuable to lose from Great Britain; and, Charles II. having
taken them under his protection, the society was there
established, and obtained the title of the Royal Society of
London.... Mr. Winthrop sent over many specimens of
the productions of this country, with his remarks upon
them: ‘and, by an order of the Royal Society, he was in
a particular manner invited to take upon himself the charge
of being the chief correspondent in the West, as Sir
Philiberto Vernatti was in the East Indies.’ ‘His name,’
says the same writer, Dr. Cromwell Mortimer, Secretary of
the Royal Society, in his flattering dedication of the fortieth
volume of the Philosophical Transactions to the Governor’s
grandson, ‘had he put it to his writings, would
have been as universally known as the Boyles’s, the Wilkins’s,
and Oldenburghs’, and been handed down to us
with similar applause.’”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> There is, in the volume of
Philosophical Transactions for 1670, “An Extract of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
Letter written by John Winthrop, Esq., Governor of Connecticut
in New England, to the Publisher, concerning
some Natural Curiosities of those Parts; especially a very
strange and curiously-contrived Fish, sent for the Repository
of the Royal Society” (pp. 3); in which are mentioned,
as sent, specimens of scrub-oak; “bark of tree
with fir-balsam, which grows in Nova Scotia, and, as I
hear, in the more easterly part of New England;” pods of
milk-weed, “used to stuff pillows and cushions;” and “a
branch of the tree called the cotton-tree, bearing a kind of
down, which also is not fit to spin.”</p>

<p>Fitz John Winthrop, Esq., F.R.S. (died 1707), son of
the last, and also Governor of Connecticut, is said to have
been “famous for his philosophical” (that is, scientific)
“knowledge.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> And the second Governor’s nephew, John
Winthrop, Esq., F.R.S. (died 1747), who left this country
and passed the latter part of his life in England, is declared
by the author of the dedication already above cited, to
have “increased the riches of their” (the Royal Society’s)
“repository with more than six hundred curious specimens,
chiefly in the mineral kingdom; accompanied with an
accurate account of each particular.” “Since Mr. Colwell,”
it is added, “the founder of the Museum of the
Royal Society, you have been the benefactor who has
given the most numerous collection.” Dr. John Winthrop,
F.R.S. (died 1779), Hollisian Professor of Mathematics at
Cambridge, N.E., whose important papers on astronomical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
and other related phenomena are to be found in the Philosophical
Transactions, was of another line of the same
family.</p>

<p>Paul Dudley, Esq., F.R.S. (born 1675), son of Gov.
Joseph Dudley, and himself Chief Justice of Massachusetts,
was author of several papers in the Philosophical Transactions;
one of which is an “Account of the Poison-wood
Tree in New-England” (vol. xxxi. p. 135); and another,
“Observations on some Plants in New-England, with
Remarkable Instances of the Nature and Power of Vegetation”
(vol. xxxiii. p. 129). This last is of only seven
pages, and of little scientific account: though we learn
from it, that, in 1726, when Mr. Dudley wrote, the Pearmain,
Kentish Pippin, and Golden Russetin, were esteemed
apples here, and the Orange and Bergamot cultivated
pears;<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> that, in one town in 1721, they made three thousand,
and in another near ten thousand barrels of cider;
and that, to speak of “trees of the wood,” he knew of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
button-wood tree which measured nine yards in girth, and
made twenty-two cords of wood; and of an ash, which, at
a yard from the ground, was fourteen feet eight inches
in girth. He also expresses an intention to treat separately
the evergreens of New England; and this treatise, which
was possibly more valuable than the one just noticed, was
in the possession of Peter Collinson, the eminent patron of
horticulture, and was given by him to J. F. Gronovius;
but has not, that I am aware of, appeared in print.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>It is likely that the early physicians of New England
gave special attention to those simples of the country, the
virtues of which were known to the savages; and perhaps
it was partly in this way that the Rev. Jared Eliot (born
1685), minister of Killingworth in Connecticut,—who is
called by Dr. Allen “the first physician of his day,”—is
also designated, both by him and by Eliot, a botanist; and
by the latter, “the first in New England.” There is no
doubt he was a friend of Dr. Franklin’s, and a scientific
agriculturist according to the knowledge of his day; and
he is said to have introduced the white mulberry into
Connecticut.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> His Agricultural Essays went through more
than one edition, but is now rare. Mr. Eliot died while
our next character, the first native New-England botanist
who deserves the name, was a student of Yale College.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>Manasseh Cutler, LL.D. (born 1743), was minister of
the Hamlet in Ipswich—afterwards incorporated as the
town of Hamilton—fifty-one years, and was also a member
of the Medical Society of Massachusetts. He is author
of “An Account of some of the Vegetable Productions
naturally growing in this part of America, botanically
arranged,” which makes nearly a hundred pages of the first
volume of the Memoirs of the American Academy, 1785.
In the introduction to this paper, the author speaks of
Canada and the Southern States having had attention
given to their productions, both by some of their own
inhabitants and by European naturalists; while “that extensive
tract of country which lies between them, including
several degrees of latitude, and exceedingly diversified
in its surface and soil, seems still to remain unexplored.”
He attributes the neglect, in part, to this,—“that botany
has never been taught in any of our colleges,” but principally
to the prevalent opinion of its unprofitableness in
common life. The latter error he combats with the then
important observation, that, “though all the medicinal
properties and economical uses of plants are not discoverable
from those characters by which they are systematically
arranged, yet the celebrated Linnæus has found that the
virtues of plants may be, in a considerable degree, and
most safely, determined by their <em>natural</em> characters: for
plants of the same <em>natural</em> class are in some measure similar;
those of the same <em>natural</em> order have a still nearer
affinity; and those of the fame genus have very seldom
been found to differ in their medical virtues” (p. 397).<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
This shows, perhaps, that Dr. Cutler appreciated (for the
<em>Italics</em> in the just-quoted passage are his own) that adumbration
of a natural system which was afforded or suggested
by the artificial; and his instances—the <i>Gramineæ</i>, the
<i>Borraginaceæ</i>, the <i>Umbelliferæ</i>, the <i>Labiatæ</i>, the <i>Cruciferæ</i>,
the <i>Malvaceæ</i>, the <i>Compositæ</i>, &amp;c.; though these are cited
under the divisions, not of the natural, but of the sexual
system—are still more to the point. There are other
observations of interest; and the suggestion is made, that
persons should collect the plants of their districts, and send
them from time to time to the Academy.</p>

<p>Dr. Cutler was thus, possibly, the first to suggest a botanical
chair in our colleges, and a general <i lang="la">herbarium</i> to
illustrate the <i>Flora</i> of New England; and perhaps it was
this last which led him to propose a still more important
undertaking. “It has long been my intention,” he says in
a letter to Prof. Swartz, of Upsal, dated 15th October,
1802, “to publish a botanical work, comprising the plants
of the northern and eastern States; and [I] have been
collecting materials for that purpose. But numerous avocations,
and a variety of other engagements, has occasioned
delay. It is, however, still my intention, if my
health permits, to do it. But, at this time, far less than in
years past, there is very little encouragement given here to
publications of this kind.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>About three hundred and seventy plants are indicated in
the published “Account” of Dr. Cutler. It was not to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
expected, that, in this beginning, numerous mistakes should
not be made. It could not possibly have been otherwise.
There is still evidence enough of the author’s genius,
which perhaps needed only opportunity and encouragement
to anticipate a part of what botany now owes to a
Nuttall, a Torrey, and a Gray. The “Account” was
favorably received by other botanists of the time, both in
this country and abroad. In a letter of Muhlenberg to
Cutler, dated 9th February, 1791, the former says, “Not
till a few months ago, I was favored with the first volume
of the Memoirs of the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences, printed at Boston, 1785. Amongst other valuable
pieces, I found your ‘Account of Indigenous Vegetables,
botanically arranged;’ with which I was infinitely
pleased, as this was the first work that gives a systematical
account of New-England plants. Being a great friend to
botany, and having studied it in my leisure-hours upwards
of fourteen years in Pennsylvania, I know the difficulty of
arranging the American plants according to <ins class="corr" id="tn-24" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'the Linnean system'">
the Linnæan system</ins>; and I was always eager to hear of some gentleman
engaged in similar researches, that, by joining hands, we
might do something towards enlarging American Botany....
This is the reason why I intrude upon your leisure-hours,
and crave for your acquaintance and friendship.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
Drs. Withering and Stokes, of England, were other correspondents
of Cutler, and furnished him with important
observations upon his printed Memoir, besides specimens;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
as did also Swartz, and, it appears, Payshull of Sweden.
Dr. Stokes followed up his various suggestions for
the improvement of the Memoir, by proposing to dedicate
a plant, which he took to be new, to its author.
“A plant,” he says, “like a woolly heath, and which I
wished to call <i>Cutleria ericoides</i>, turns out to be <i>Hudsonia
ericoides</i>. I hope, however, your herborizations may
furnish a new genus for you, not likely to be disturbed.”—<cite>Letters
of Stokes to Cutler</cite>, from “Feb. 14 ’91, to Aug.
17, ’93.”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>But Dr. Cutler’s printed memoir on the plants of New
England is much surpassed in interest by his manuscript
volumes of descriptions, still extant. These manuscript
volumes commence with “Book I., 1783,” and continue, so
far as I have seen them, to 1804. The late Mr. Oakes
possessed six of these books; and two were given to me by
my valued friend, the late Dr. T. W. Harris. They are
generally entitled, “Descriptions and Notes on American
Indigenous Plants,” and contain a vast number of observations
and analyses, sometimes accompanied by pen-and-ink
sketches. This was evidently the material accumulated
for the author’s <i>Flora</i> above mentioned; and the following
extracts will serve to show that he was in many respects
qualified to undertake such a work. Thus, in describing
the several hickories, he points out those differences from
<i>Juglans</i>, upon which Nuttall afterwards constituted his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
genus <i>Carya</i>. Again, in the same volume,—that for
1789,—there is a <i>N. Gen. Anonymos</i>, minutely described
in several pages, which is no other than <i>Thesium umbellatum</i>,
L., afterwards distinguished by Nuttall as his genus
<i>Comandra</i>. Again, under <i>Anonymos, Yellow-Sandbind</i>,
there is a full description of what Nuttall after named
<i>Hudsonia tomentosa</i>. The same volume shows that the
author had anticipated Prof. Gray in referring <i>Orchis
fimbriata</i>, as it was called by Pursh and other botanists, to
<i>O. psychodes</i>, L.; and the remark is also made that <i>O.
lacera</i> Michx.,—which Muhlenberg and our other writers
had mistakenly referred to <i>O. psychodes</i>, till Dr. Gray corrected
the error,—“must be a new species,” which it then
certainly was. Again, there is another <i>Anomolos</i> described
at length, which is the same afterwards constituted by
Nuttall his genus <i>Microstylis</i>. So <i>Campanula humida</i>
(Cutler mss.) is what Pursh designated, long after, <i>C.
aparinoides</i>. Again, in another volume (for 1800), he
anticipates Pursh by proposing for our water-shield the
name <i>Brasenia ovalifolia</i>; and, in yet another, he is before
Bigelow in describing as a new species what the latter,
many years later, published as <i>Prunus obovata</i>. This may
suffice to indicate the merits of the botanist of Ipswich
Hamlet. A little shrub-willow, with clean, shining leaves,
and modest catkins,—inhabiting, almost everywhere, the
alpine regions of the White Mountains, and gathered by
him there, before any other botanist had penetrated those
solitudes,—still reminds us of his name, which deserves to
be remembered by his countrymen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>After Cutler, there appeared nothing of importance<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> on
our botany, till the present elder school of New-England
botanists—a school characterized by the names of an
Oakes, a Boott, and an Emerson—was founded, now more
than forty years ago, by the classical <i>Florula</i> of Bigelow.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the year of our Lord 1663. <em>May 28.</em>
upon an Invitation from my only Brother,
I departed from <em>London</em>, and arrived at
<em>Boston</em>, the chief Town in the <em>Massachusetts</em>,
a Colony of <em>Englishmen</em> in <em>New-England</em>,
the <em>28th</em> of <em>July</em> following.</p>

<p><em>Boston</em> (whose longitude is 315 deg. and 42 deg. 30
min. of North Latitude) is built on the South-west side
of a Bay large enough for the Anchorage of 500 Sail of
Ships, the Buildings are handsome, joyning one to the
other as in <em>London</em>, with many large streets, most of them
paved with pebble stone, in the high street towards the
Common, there are fair buildings, some of stone, and at
the East End of the {2} Town one amongst the rest, built
by the Shore by Mr. <em>Gibs</em>, a Merchant, being a stately
Edifice, which it is thought will stand him in little less<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
than 3000 <em>l.</em> before it be fully finished.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The Town is
not divided into Parishes, yet they have three fair Meeting-houses
or Churches, which hardly suffice to receive the
Inhabitants and Strangers that come in from all parts.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Having refreshed my self here for some time, and opportunely
lighting upon a passage in a Bark belonging to a
Friend of my Brothers, and bound to the Eastward, I put
to sea again, and on the Fifteenth of <em>August</em>, I arrived at
<em>Black-point</em>, otherwise called <em>Scarborow</em>, the habitation of
my beloved Brother,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> being about an hundred leagues to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
Eastward of <em>Boston</em>; here I resided eight years, and made it
my business to discover all along the Natural, Physical, and
Chyrurgical Rarities of this New-found World.</p>

<p><em>New-England</em> is said to begin at 40 and to end at 46 of
Northerly Latitude, that is from <em>de la Ware</em> Bay to <em>New-found-Land</em>.</p>

<p id="P03">The Sea Coasts are accounted wholsomest, the East and
South Winds coming {3} from Sea produceth warm weather,
the Northwest coming over land causeth extremity of
Cold, and many times strikes the Inhabitants both <em>English</em>
and <em>Indian</em> with that sad Disease called there the Plague
of the back, but with us <em>Empiema</em>.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The Country generally is Rocky and Mountanous, and
extremely overgrown with wood, yet here and there beautified
with large rich Valleys, wherein are Lakes ten,
twenty, yea sixty miles in compass, out of which our great
Rivers have their Beginnings.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Fourscore miles (upon a direct line) to the Northwest
of <em>Scarborow</em>, a Ridge of Mountains run Northwest and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
Northeast an hundred Leagues, known by the name of the
<em>White Mountains</em>, upon which lieth Snow all the year, and
is a Land-mark twenty miles off at Sea. It is rising
ground from the Sea shore to these Hills, and they are
inaccessible but by the Gullies which the dissolved Snow
hath made; in these Gullies grow <em>Saven</em> Bushes, which
being taken hold of are a good help to the climbing Discoverer;
upon the top of the highest of these Mountains
is a large Level {4} or Plain of a days journey over,
whereon nothing grows but Moss: at the farther end of
this Plain is another Hill called the <em>Sugar-Loaf</em>, to outward
appearance a rude heap of massie stones piled one
upon another, and you may as you ascend step from one
stone to another, as if you were going up a pair of stairs,
but winding still about the Hill till you come to the top,
which will require half a days time, and yet it is not
above a Mile, where there is also a Level of about an
Acre of ground, with a pond of clear water in the midst of
it; which you may hear run down, but how it ascends is a
mystery. From this rocky Hill you may see the whole
Country round about; it is far above the lower Clouds,
and from hence we beheld a Vapour (like a great Pillar)
drawn up by the Sun Beams out of a great Lake or Pond
into the Air, where it was formed into a Cloud. The
Country beyond these Hills Northward is daunting terrible,
being full of rocky Hills, as thick as Mole-hills in a
Meadow, and cloathed with infinite thick Woods.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p><em>New-England</em> is by some affirmed to be an Island,
bounded on the North with the {5} River <em>Canada</em>, (so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
called from Monsieur <em>Cane</em>) on the South with the River
<em>Mohegan</em>, or <em>Hudsons</em> River, so called because he was
the first that discovered it.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Some will have <em>America</em> to be
an Island, which out of question must needs be, if there be
a Northeast passage found out into the South Sea; it contains
1152400000 Acres. The discovery of the Northwest
passage (which lies within the River of <em>Canada</em>) was
undertaken with the help of some Protestant <em>Frenchmen</em>,
which left <em>Canada</em> and retired to <em>Boston</em> about the year 1669.
The Northeast people of <em>America</em> i.e. <em>New England</em>, <em>&amp;c.</em>
are judged to be <em>Tartars</em> called <em>Samoades</em>, being alike in
complexion, shape, habit and manners, (see the <em>Globe</em>:)
Their Language is very significant, using but few words,
every word having a diverse signification, which is exprest
by their gesture; as when they hold their head of one side
the word signifieth one thing, holding their hand up when
they pronounce it signifieth another thing. Their Speeches
in their Assemblies are very gravely delivered, commonly
in perfect <em>Hexamiter</em> Verse, with great silence and
attention, and answered again <i lang="la">ex tempore</i> after the same
manner.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>{6} Having given you some short Notes concerning the
Country in general, I shall now enter upon the proposed
Discovery of the Natural, Physical, and Chyrurgical Rarities;
and that I may methodically deliver them unto you,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
I shall cast them into this form: 1. Birds. 2. Beasts. 3.
Fishes. 4. Serpents and Insects. 5. Plants, of these, 1.
such Plants as are common with us, 2. of such Plants as
are proper to the country, 3. of such Plants as are proper
to the Country and have no name known to us, 4. of such
Plants as have sprung up since the <em>English</em> Planted and
kept Cattle there, 5. of such Garden Herbs (amongst us)
as do thrive there and of such as do not. 6. Of Stones,
Minerals, Metals, and Earths.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><em>The Humming Bird.</em></p>

<p class="drop-capy">The <em>Humming Bird</em>, the least of all Birds, little bigger
than a <em>Dor</em>, of variable glittering Colours, they feed
upon Honey, which they suck out of Blossoms {7} and
Flowers with their long Needle-like Bills; they sleep all
Winter, and are not to be seen till the Spring, at which
time they breed in little Nests, made up like a bottom of
soft, Silk-like matter, their Eggs no bigger than a white
Pease, they hatch three or four at a time, and are proper
to this Country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>


<p class="center"><em>The Troculus.</em><a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The <em>Troculus</em>, a small Bird, black and white, no bigger
than a Swallow, the points of whose Feathers are sharp,
which they stick into the sides of the Chymney (to rest
themselves, their Legs being exceeding short) where they
breed in Nests made like a Swallows Nest, but of a glewy
substance, and which is not fastened to the Chymney as a
Swallows Nest, but hangs down the Chymney by a clew-like
string a yard long. They commonly have four or five
young ones, and when they go away, which is much about
the time that Swallows use to depart, they never fail to
throw down one of their young Birds into the room by
way of Gratitude. I have more than once observed, that
against the ruin of the Family these Birds will suddenly
forsake the house and come no more.</p>


<p class="center">{8} <em>The Pilhannaw.</em><a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>The <em>Pilhannaw</em> or <em>Mechquan</em>, much like the description
of the <em>Indian Ruck</em>, a monstrous great Bird, a kind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
of Hawk, some say an Eagle, four times as big as a Goshawk,
white Mail’d, having two or three purple Feathers
in her head as long as Geeses Feathers they make Pens
of the Quills of these Feathers are purple, as big as
Swans Quills and transparent; her Head is as big as a
Childs of a year old, a very Princely Bird; when she
soars abroad, all sort of feathered Creatures hide themselves,
yet she never preys upon any of them, but upon
<em>Fawns</em> and <em>Jaccals</em>: She Ayries in the Woods upon the
high Hills of <em>Ossapy</em>, and is very rarely or seldome seen.</p>


<p class="center"><em>The Turkie.</em><a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>The <em>Turkie</em>, who is blacker than ours; I have heard
several credible persons affirm, they have seen <em>Turkie<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
Cocks</em> that have weighed forty, yea sixty pound; but out
of my personal experimental knowledge I can assure you,
that I have eaten my share of a <em>Turkie Cock</em>, that when he
was pull’d and garbidg’d, weighed thirty {9} pound; and
I have also seen threescore broods of young <em>Turkies</em> on
the side of a marsh, sunning of themselves in a morning
betimes, but this was thirty years since, the <em>English</em> and
the <em>Indians</em> having now destroyed the breed, so that ’tis
very rare to meet with a wild <em>Turkie</em> in the Woods; But
some of the <em>English</em> bring up great store of the wild kind,
which remain about their Houses as tame as ours in
<em>England</em>.</p>


<p class="center"><em>The Goose.</em><a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>The <em>Goose</em>, of which there are three kinds; the <em>Gray
Goose</em>, the <em>White Goose</em>, and the <em>Brant</em>: The <em>Goose</em> will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
live a long time; I once found in a <em>White Goose</em> three
Hearts, she was a very old one, and so tuff, that we gladly
gave her over although exceeding well roasted.</p>


<p class="center"><em>The Bloody-Flux Cured.</em></p>

<p>A Friend of mine of good Quality living sometime in
<em>Virginia</em> was sore troubled for a long time with the
<em>Bloody-Flux</em>, having tryed several Remedies by the advice
of his Friends without any good effect, at last was induced
with a longing desire to drink the <em>Fat Dripping</em>
{10} of a Goose newly taken from the Fire, which absolutely
cured him, who was in despair of ever recovering
his health again.</p>


<p class="center"><em>The Gripe and Vulture.</em></p>

<p>The <em>Gripe</em>, which is of two kinds, the one with a White
Head, the other with a black Head, this we take for the
<em>Vulture</em>. They are both cowardly <em>Kites</em>,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> preying upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
Fish cast up on the shore. In the year 1668 there was a
great mortality of Eels in <em>Casco Bay</em>, thither resorted at
the same time an infinite number of <em>Gripes</em>, insomuch
that being shot by the Inhabitants, they fed their Hogs
with them for some weeks; at other times you shall seldom
see above two or three in a dozen miles travelling.
The <em>Quill Feathers</em> in their Wings make excellent <em>Text
Pens</em>, and the Feathers of their Tail are highly esteemed
by the <em>Indians</em> for their Arrows, they will not sing in
flying; a <em>Gripes</em> Tail is worth a <em>Beavers</em> Skin, up in the
Country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>


<p class="center"><em>A Remedy for the Coldness and pain of the Stomach.</em></p>

<p>The Skin of a <em>Gripe</em> drest with the doun on, is good to
wear upon the Stomach for the Pain and Coldness of it.</p>


<p class="center">{11} <em>The Osprey.</em></p>

<p>The <em>Osprey</em>, which in this Country is white mail’d.</p>


<p class="center"><em>A Remedy for the Tooth-ach.</em></p>

<p>Their Beaks excell for the Tooth-ach, picking the
Gums therewith till they bleed.</p>


<p class="center"><em>The Wobble.</em><a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>The <em>Wobble</em>, an ill shaped Fowl, having no long Feathers
in their Pinions, which is the reason they cannot fly,
not much unlike the <em>Pengwin</em>; they are in the Spring
very fat, or rather oyly, but pull’d and garbidg’d, and laid
to the Fire to roast, they yield not one drop.</p>


<p class="center"><em>For Aches.</em></p>

<p>Our way (for they are very soveraign for <em>Aches</em>) is to
make Mummy of them, that is, to salt them well, and dry
them in an earthern pot well glazed in an Oven; or else
(which is the better way) to burn them under ground for
a day or two, then quarter them and stew them in a Tin
Stewpan with a very little water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>


<p class="center">{12} <em>The Loone.</em></p>

<p>The <em>Loone</em> is a Water Fowl, alike in shape to the <em>Wobble</em>,
and as virtual for Aches, which we order after the
same manner.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>


<p class="center"><em>The Owl.</em></p>

<p>The <em>Owl</em>, <i>Avis devia</i>, which are of three kinds; the
great <em>Gray Owl</em> with Ears, the little <em>Gray Owl</em>, and the
<em>White Owl</em> which is no bigger than a <em>Thrush</em>.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>


<p class="center"><em>The Turkie Buzzard.</em></p>

<p>The <em>Turkie Buzzard</em>, a kind of <em>Kite</em>, but as big as a
<em>Turkie</em>, brown of colour, and very good meat.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>


<p class="center"><em>What Birds are not to be found in</em> New-England.</p>

<p>Now, by what the country hath not, you may ghess at

</div>


<p class="center"><em>The Bear, which are generally Black.</em><a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>The <em>Bear</em>, they live four months in Caves, that is all
Winter; in the Spring they bring forth their young
ones, they seldome have above three Cubbs in a litter, are
very fat in the Fall of the Leaf with feeding upon Acorns,
at which time they are excellent Venison; their Brains are
venomous; They feed much upon water Plantane in the
Spring and Summer, and Berries, and also upon a shell-fish
called a <em>Horse-foot</em>; and are never mankind, i.e. fierce, but
in rutting time, and then they walk the Country twenty,
thirty, forty in a company, making a hideous noise with
roaring, which you may hear a mile or two before they
come so near to endanger the Traveller. About four
years since, Acorns being very scarce up in the Country,
some numbers of them came down {14} amongst the
<em>English</em> Plantations, which generally are by the Sea side;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
at one Town called <em>Gorgiana</em> in the Province of <em>Meyn</em>
(called also <em>New-Sommerset-shire</em>) they kill’d fourscore.</p>


<p class="center"><em>For Aches and Cold Swellings.</em></p>

<p>Their Grease is very good for Aches and Cold Swellings,
the <em>Indians</em> anoint themselves therewith from top
to toe, which hardens them against the cold weather. A
black Bears Skin heretofore was worth forty shillings,
now you may have one for ten, much used by the <em>English</em>
for Beds and Coverlets, and by the <em>Indians</em> for Coats.</p>


<p class="center"><em>For Pain and Lameness upon Cold.</em></p>

<p>One <em>Edw. Andrews</em> being foxt,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and falling backward
cross a Thought<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> in a Shallop or Fisher-boat, and taking
cold upon it, grew crooked, lame, and full of pain, was
cured, lying one Winter upon Bears Skins newly flead off,
with some upon him, so that he sweat every night.</p>


<p class="center"><em>The Wolf.</em><a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>The <em>Wolf</em>, of which there are two kinds; one with a
round-ball’d Foot, and {15} are in shape like mungrel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
Mastiffs; the other with a flat Foot, these are liker Greyhounds,
and are called <em>Deer Wolfs</em>, because they are
accustomed to prey upon <em>Deer</em>. A <em>Wolf</em> will eat a <em>Wolf</em>
new dead, and so do <em>Bears</em> as I suppose, for their dead
Carkases are never found, neither by the <em>Indian</em> nor
<em>English</em>. They go a clicketing twelve days, and have as
many Whelps at a Litter as a Bitch. The <em>Indian Dog</em><a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> is
a Creature begotten ’twixt a <em>Wolf</em> and a <em>Fox</em>, which the
<em>Indians</em> lighting upon, bring up to hunt the <em>Deer</em> with.
The <em>Wolf</em> is very numerous, and go in companies, sometimes
ten, twenty, more or fewer, and so cunning, that
seldome any are kill’d with Guns or Traps; but of late
they have invented a way to destroy them, by binding four
<em>Maycril Hooks</em> a cross with a brown thread, and then
wrapping some Wool about them, they dip them in melted
Tallow till it be as round and as big as an Egg; these
(when any Beast hath been kill’d by the <em>Wolves</em>) they
scatter by the dead Carkase, after they have beaten off the
<em>Wolves</em>; about Midnight the <em>Wolves</em> are sure to return
again to the place where they left the slaughtered Beast,
and the {16} first thing they venture upon will be these
balls of fat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>


<p class="center"><em>For old Aches.</em></p>

<p>A black <em>Wolfs</em> Skin is worth a <em>Beaver</em> Skin among the
<em>Indians</em>, being highly esteemed for helping old Aches in
old people, worn as a Coat; they are not mankind, as
in <em>Ireland</em> and other Countries, but do much harm by
destroying of our <em>English</em> Cattle.</p>


<p class="center"><em>The Ounce.</em><a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The <em>Ounce</em> or <em>Wild Cat</em>, is about the bigness of two
lusty Ram Cats, preys upon Deer and our <em>English</em> Poultrey:
I once found six whole Ducks in the belly of one I
killed by a Pond side: Their flesh roasted is as good as
Lamb, and as white.</p>


<p class="center"><em>For Aches and shrunk Sinews.</em></p>

<p>Their Grease is soveraign for all manner of Aches and
shrunk Sinews: Their Skins are accounted good Fur, but
somewhat course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>


<p class="center">{17} <em>The Raccoon.</em><a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>The <em>Raccoon</em> liveth in hollow trees, and is about the
size of a <em>Gib Cat</em>; they feed upon Mass, and do infest
our <em>Indian</em> Corn very much; they will be exceeding fat
in Autumn; their flesh is somewhat dark, but good food
roasted.</p>


<p class="center"><em>For Bruises and Aches.</em></p>

<p>Their Fat is excellent for bruises and Aches. Their
Skins are esteemed a good deep Fur; but yet as the
<em>Wild Cats</em> somewhat coarse.</p>


<p class="center"><em>The Porcupine.</em></p>

<p>The <em>Porcupine</em>, in some parts of the Countrey Eastward
towards the <em>French</em>, are as big as an ordinary Mungrel
Cur; a very angry Creature, and dangerous, shooting a
whole shower of Quills with a rowse at their enemies,
which are of that nature, that wherever they stick in the
flesh, they will work through in a short time, if not prevented
by pulling of them out. The <em>Indians</em> make use of
their Quills, which are hardly a handful long, to adorn
{18} the edges of their birchen dishes, and weave (dying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
some of them red, others yellow and blew) curious bags
or pouches, in works like <em>Turkie-work</em>.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>


<p class="center"><em>The Beaver, Canis Ponticus, Amphybious.</em><a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>The <em>Beaver</em>, whose old ones are as big as an <em>Otter</em>, or
rather bigger, a Creature of a rare instinct, as may apparently
be seen in their artificial Dam-heads to raise the
water in the Ponds where they keep, and their houses
having three stories, which would be too large to discourse.<a id="FNanchor_54a" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
They have all of them four Cods hanging outwardly
between their hinder legs, two of them are soft or
oyly, and two solid or hard; the <em>Indians</em> say they are
<em>Hermaphrodites</em>.</p>


<p class="center"><em>For Wind in the Stomach.</em></p>

<p>Their solid Cods are much used in Physick: Our <em>Englishwomen</em>
in this Country use the powder grated, as much as
will lye upon a shilling in a draught of <em>Fiol</em> Wine, for
Wind in the Stomach and Belly, and venture many times
in such cases to give it to Women with Child: Their
Tails are flat, and covered with Scales without hair, {19}
which being flead off, and the Tail boiled, proves exceeding
good meat, being all Fat, and as sweet as Marrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>


<p class="center"><em>The Moose-Deer.</em><a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>The <em>Moose Deer</em>, which is a very goodly Creature, some
of them twelve foot high, with exceeding fair Horns with
broad Palms, some of them two fathom from the tip of
one Horn to the other; they commonly have three
<em>Fawns</em> at a time, their flesh is not dry like Deers flesh,
but moist and lushious somewhat like Horse flesh (as they
judge that have tasted of both) but very wholsome. The
flesh of their <em>Fawns</em> is an incomparable dish, beyond the
flesh of an Asses Foal so highly esteemed by the <em>Romans</em>,
or that of young Spaniel Puppies so much cried up in our
days in <em>France</em> and <em>England</em>.</p>


<p class="center"><em>Moose Horns better for Physick Use than Harts Horns.</em></p>

<p>Their Horns are far better (in my opinion) for Physick
than the Horns of other Deer, as being of a stronger
nature: As for their Claws, which both <em>Englishmen</em> and
<em>French</em> make use of for <em>Elk</em>, I cannot {20} approve so to
be from the Effects, having had some trial of it; besides,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
all that write of the <em>Elk</em> describe him with a tuft of hair
on the left Leg behind, a little above the pastern joynt on
the outside of the Leg, not unlike the tuft (as I conceive)
that groweth upon the breast of a <em>Turkie Cock</em>, which I
could never yet see upon the Leg of a <em>Moose</em>, and I have
seen some number of them.</p>


<p class="center"><em>For Children breeding Teeth.</em></p>

<p>The <em>Indian Webbes</em> make use of the broad Teeth of the
<em>Fawns</em> to hang about their Childrens Neck when they are
breeding of their Teeth. The Tongue of a grown <em>Moose</em>,
dried in the smoak after the <em>Indian</em> manner, is a dish for a
<em>Sagamor</em>.</p>


<p class="center"><em>The Maccarib.</em><a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>The <em>Maccarib</em>, <em>Caribo</em>, or <em>Pohano</em>, a kind of Deer, as
big as a Stag, round hooved, smooth hair’d and soft as silk;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
their Horns grow backwards a long their backs to their
rumps, and turn again a handful beyond their Nose, having
another Horn in the middle of their Forehead, about
half a yard long, very straight, but {21} wreathed like an
<em>Unicorns</em> Horn, of a brown jettie colour, and very
smooth: The Creature is no where to be found, but upon
Cape <em>Sable</em> in the <em>French</em> Quarters, and there too very
rarely, they being not numerous; some few of their Skins
and their streight Horns are (but very sparingly) brought
to the <em>English</em>.</p>


<p class="center"><em>The Fox.</em><a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>The <em>Fox</em>, which differeth not much from ours, but are
somewhat less; a black <em>Fox</em> Skin heretofore was wont to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
be valued at fifty and sixty pound, but now you may have
them for twenty shillings; indeed there is not any in <em>New-England</em>
that are perfectly black, but silver hair’d, that is
sprinkled with grey hairs.</p>


<p class="center"><em>The Jaccal.</em><a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>The <em>Jaccal</em>, is a Creature that hunts the <em>Lions</em> prey, a
shrew’d sign that there are <em>Lions</em> upon the Continent; there
are those that are yet living in the Countrey, that do constantly
affirm, that about six or seven and thirty years since
an <em>Indian</em> {22} shot a young <em>Lion</em>,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> sleeping upon the body<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
of an Oak blown up by the roots, with an Arrow, not far
from Cape <em>Anne</em>, and sold the Skin to the <em>English</em>. But
to say something of the <em>Jaccal</em>, they are ordinarily less
than <em>Foxes</em>, of the colour of a gray Rabbet, and do not
scent nothing near so strong as a <em>Fox</em>; some of the <em>Indians</em>
will eat of them: Their Grease is good for all that
<em>Fox</em> Grease is good for, but weaker; they are very numerous.</p>


<p class="center"><em>The Hare.</em><a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>The <em>Hare</em> in <em>New-England</em> is no bigger than our
<em>English</em> Rabbets, of the same colour, but withall having
yellow and black strokes down the ribs; in Winter they
are milk white, and as the Spring approacheth they come
to their colour; when the Snow lies upon the ground
they are very bitter with feeding upon the bark of Spruce,
and the like.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>In the Head of this Fish is found a Stone, or rather a
Bone, which being pulveriz’d and drank in any convenient

Likewise,</p>


<p class="center">{33} <em>For the Stone.</em></p>

<p class="center" id="P34">{34} <em>The Stingray.</em></p>

<p>The <em>Stingray</em>, a large Fish, of a rough Skin, good to
cover Boxes and Hafts of Knives, and Rapier sticks.</p>


<p class="center"><em>The Tortous.</em></p>

<p>The <em>Turtle</em> or <em>Tortous</em>, of which there are three kinds:<br>
1. The land <em>Turtle</em>; they are found in dry sandy Banks,
under old Houses, and never go into the water.</p>


<p class="center"><em>For the Ptisick, Consumption, and Morbus Gallicus.</em></p>

<p>They are good for the Ptisick and Consumptions, and

<p>The <em>Soile</em> or <em>Sea Calf</em>, a Creature that brings forth her
young ones upon dry land, but at other times keeps in
the Sea preying upon Fish.</p>

<p>The Oyl of it is much used by the <em>Indians</em>, who eat of
it with their Fish, and anoint their limbs therewith, and
their Wounds and Sores: It is very good for Scalds and
Burns; and the fume of it, being cast upon Coals, will
bring Women out of the Mother Fits. The Hair upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>

with the Hair on, are good to make Gloves for the Winter.</p>


<p class="center"><em>The Sperma Ceti Whale.</em></p>

<p>The <em>Sperma Ceti Whale</em> differeth from the <em>Whales</em> that
yield us Whale-bones, for the first hath great and long
Teeth, the other is nothing but Bones with Tassels hanging
from their Jaws, with which they suck in their prey.</p>


<p class="center"><em>What Sperma Ceti is.</em></p>

<p>It is not long since a <em>Sperma Ceti Whale</em> or two were
cast upon the shore, not far from <em>Boston</em> in the <em>Massachusetts
Bay</em>, which being cut into small pieces and boiled in
Cauldrons, yielded plenty of Oyl; the Oyl put up into
Hogsheads, and flow’d into Cellars for some time, Candies
at the {36} bottom, it may be one quarter; then the Oyl is
drawn off, and the Candied Stuff put up into convenient
Vessels is sold for <em>Sperma Ceti</em>, and is right <em>Sperma Ceti</em>.</p>


<p class="center"><em>For Bruises and Aches.</em></p>

<p>The Oyl that was drawn off Candies again and again, if
well ordered; and is admirable for Bruises and Aches.</p>


<p class="center"><em>What Ambergreece is.</em></p>

<p>Now you must understand this <em>Whale</em> feeds upon <em>Ambergreece</em>,
as is apparent, finding it in the <em>Whales</em> Maw in
great quantity, but altered and excrementitious: I conceive
that <em>Ambergreece</em> is no other than a kind of Mushroom
growing at the bottom of some Seas; I was once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
shewed (by a Mariner) a piece of <em>Ambergreece</em> having a
root to it like that of the land Mushroom, which the
<em>Whale</em> breaking up, some scape his devouring Paunch, and
is afterwards cast upon shore.</p>


<p class="center" id="P36"><em>The Coccle.</em><a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

Beads called <em>Wompampeag</em> and <em>Mohaicks</em>, the first are
white, the other blew, both <em>Orient</em>, and beau{37}tified
with a purple Vein. The white Beads are very good to
stanch Blood.</p>


<p class="center"><em>The Scarlet Muscle.</em></p>

<p>The <em>Scarlet Muscle</em>, at <em>Paschatawey</em> a Plantation about
fifty leagues by Sea Eastward from <em>Boston</em>, in a small <em>Cove</em>
called <em>Bakers Cove</em> there is found this kind of <em>Muscle</em>
which hath a purple Vein, which being prickt with a
Needle yieldeth a perfect purple or scarlet juice, dying
Linnen so that no washing will wear it out, but keeps its
lustre many years: We mark our Handkerchiefs and
Shirts with it.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>


<p class="center"><em>Fish of greatest Esteem in the West Indies.</em></p>

hollow of these Fangs are as black as Ink: The <em>Indians</em>,
when weary with travelling, will {39} take them up with
their bare hands, laying hold with one hand behind their
Head, with the other taking hold of their Tail, and, with
their teeth tear off the Skin of their backs, and feed upon
them alive; which they say refresheth them.</p>


<p class="center"><em>For frozen Limbs, Aches, and Bruises.</em></p>

<p>They have Leafs of Fat in their Bellies, which is excellent
to annoint frozen Limbs, and for Aches and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>

Bitings is a present Remedy.</p>

<p class="drop-capy">I<em>ndian</em> Wheat, of which there is three sorts, yellow,
red, and blew; the blew is commonly Ripe before
the other a Month: Five or Six Grains of <em>Indian</em> Wheat
hath produced in one year 600. It is hotter than our
Wheat and clammy; excellent in <em>Cataplasms</em> to ripen
any Swelling or impostume. The decoction of the blew
Corn, is good to wash sore Mouths with: It is light of
digestion, and the <em>English</em> make a kind of Loblolly of it
{53} to eat with Milk, which they call <em>Sampe</em>; they beat
it in a Morter, and sift the flower out of it: the remainder
they call <em>Homminey</em>, which they put into a Pot of two or
three Gallons, with Water, and boyl it upon a gentle Fire
till it be like a Hasty Pudden; they put of this into Milk,
and so eat it. Their Bread also they make of the <em>Homminey</em>
so boiled, and mix their Flower with it, cast it into a
deep Bason in which they form the Loaf, and then turn
it out upon the Peel, and presently put it into the Oven
before it spreads abroad; the Flower makes excellent
Puddens.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

feed upon these Plants. Their Cods sent as sweet and as
strong as Musk, and will last along time handsomly

lying flat on the ground, where at distances, they take
Root, over-spreading sometimes half a score Acres, sometimes
in small patches of about a Rood or the like; the
Leaves are like Box, but greener, thick and glittering; the
Blossoms are very like the Flowers of {66} our <em>English

long small foot stalks, no bigger than a hair; at first they
are of a pale yellow Colour, afterwards red, and as big as

<p>This Plant was brought to me by a neighbour, who
(wandering in the Woods to find out his strayed Cattle,)
lost himself {69} for two Dayes, being as he ghessed
eight or ten Miles from the Sea-side. The Root was
pretty thick and black, having a number of small black
strings growing from it, the stalks of the Leaves about a
handful long, the Leaves were round and as big as a
Silver five Shilling piece, of a sap or dark green Colour,
with a line or ribb as black as Jeat round the Circumference,
from whence came black lines or ribs at equal
distance, all of them meeting in a black spot in the Center.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
If I had staid longer in the Country, I should have purposely
made a Journey into those Parts where it was
gathered, to discover if possible, the Stalk and Flower;
but now I shall refer it to those that are younger, and
better able to undergo the pains and trouble of finding it
out; for I understood by the Natives, that it is not common,
that is, every where to be found, no more then the
embroydered <em>Pirola</em>, which also is a most elegant Plant,
and which I did endeavour to bring over, but it perished at
Sea.</p>

<p>The Leaf is like a Nettle Leaf, but narrower and
longer; the stalk about the bigness of a Nettle stalk,
Champhered and hollow, and of a dusky red Colour;

<p>This Plant Flowers in <em>August</em>, and grows in wet
Ground; it is about three or four foot in height, having
a square slender stalk, chamfered, hollow and tuff, the
Leaves grow at certain distances one against another, of
the colour of <em>Egrimony</em> Leaves sharpe pointed, broadest
in the midst about an Inch and half, and three or four
Inches in length, snipt about the edges like a Nettle Leaf,
at the top of the Stalk for four or five Inches thick, set
with pale green husks, out of which the Flowers grow,
consisting of one Leaf, shaped like the head of a Serpent,
opening at the top like a mouth, and hollow throughout,
containing four crooked pointels, and on the top of every
pointel a small, glistering, green button, covered with a
little white woolly matter, by which they are with the
pointels fastened close together and shore up the tip of
the upper chap, the crooked pointels are very stiff and
hard, from the bottom of the husks, wherein the Flower
stands, from the top of the Seed Vessel shoots out a
white thread which runs in at the bottom of the Flower,
and so {80} out at the mouth; the whole Flower is milk
white, the inside of the chaps reddish, the Root I did not
observe.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>This Plant I take for a varigated Herb <em>Paris</em>, <em>True Love</em>
or <em>One Berry</em>, or rather <em>One Flower</em>, which is milk white,
and made up with four Leaves, with many black threads
in the middle, upon every thread grows a Berry (when
the Leaves of the Flower are fallen) as big as a white
pease, of a light red colour when they are ripe, and clustering
together in a round form as big as a Pullets Egg,
which at distance shews but as one Berry, very pleasant
in taste, and not unwholsome; the Root, Leaf, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
Flower differ not from our <em>English</em> kind, and their time of
blooming and ripening agree, and therefore doubtless a
kind of <i>Herba Paris</i>.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>This Plant is taken by our Simplists to be a kind of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
<em>Golden Rod</em>, by others for <em>Sarazens Consound</em>. I judge
it to be a kind of small <em>Sun Flower</em>, or <em>Marygold</em> of the
<em>West Indies</em>; the Root is brown and slender, a foot and
half in length, running a slope under the upper face of the
Earth, with some strings here and there, the stalk as big as
the steal of a Tobacco pipe, full of pith, commonly brownish,
sometimes purple, three or four foot high, the Leaves
grow at a distance one against another, rough, hard, green
above, and gray underneath, slightly snipt and the ribs
appear most on the back side of the Leaf, the Flower is of
a bright yellow, with little yellow cups in the midst, as in
the <em>Marygold</em> of <em>Peru</em>, with black threads in them with
yellow pointels, the Flower spreads it self abroad out of a
cup made up of many green beards, not unlike a Thistle;
Within a handful of the top of the stalk (when the Flower
is fallen), growes an excrense or knob as big as a Walnut,
which being broken yieldeth a kind of <em>Turpentine</em> or
rather <em>Rosen</em>.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>


<p class="center"><em>What Cutchenele is.</em></p>

<p>The stalk beneath and above the knob, covered with a
multitude of small Bugs, about the bigness of a great flea,
which I presume will make good <em>Cutchenele</em>, ordered as
they should be before they come to have Wings: They
make a perfect Scarlet Colour to Paint with, and durable.</p>

<em>Famouth</em>; where for some time she swaged the Pain of her
Sore, by bathing it with strong Malt Beer, which it would

she could come by no more Beer, (for it was brought from
<em>Boston</em>, along the Coasts by Merchants,) she made use of
<em>Rhum</em>, a strong Water drawn from Sugar Canes, with
which it was lull’d a sleep; at last, (to be rid of it altogether)
she put a quantity of <em>Arsnick</em> to the <em>Rhum</em>, and
bathing of it as formerly, she utterly destroyed it, and Cured
her self; but her kind Husband, who sucked out the Poyson
as the Sore was healing, lost all his Teeth, but without
further danger or inconvenience.</p>

Faucious, <em>i.e.</em> without Beards; but the Women many of
them {100} have very good Features; seldome without a

them black Eyed, having even short Teeth, and very white;
their Hair black, thick and long, broad Breasted; handsome
streight Bodies, and slender, considering their constant
loose habit: Their limbs cleanly, straight, and of a
convenient stature, generally, as plump as Partridges, and
saving here and there one, of a modest deportment.</p>


<p class="p1">Their Garments are a pair of Sleeves of Deer, or Moose
skin drest, and drawn with lines of several Colours into
Asiatick Works, with Buskins of the same, a short Mantle
of Trading Cloath, either Blew or Red, fastened with
a knot under the Chin, and girt about the middle with a
Zone, wrought with white and blew Beads into pretty
Works; of these Beads they have Bracelets for their Neck
and Arms, and Links to hang in their Ears, and a fair
Table curiously made up with Beads likewise, to wear
before their Breast; their Hair they Combe backward, and
tye it up short with a Border, about two handfulls broad,
{101} wrought in Works as the other with their Beads:

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> But there is no doubt that the author was himself as far from sharing in the
serious English thought of the Puritans of Massachusetts Bay as he was from
joining in their evangelical faith. Yet there is hardly more than one place in
either of his books (Voyages, pp. 180-2) where this is offensively brought forward.
It is worthy of remark, however, that Josselyn’s family, in England, was attached
rather to the Puritan side. “His family connections,” says Mr. Hunter, in the
letter already referred to, “appear to have been adherents to the cause of the
Parliament; particularly the Harlakendens, in whose regiment a Jocelyn, named
Ralph, was a chaplain.” Nor is this all. “In the year 1663,” continues the
learned authority just cited, “there was a slight insurrectionary movement in
the North; which was easily put down by the government, and the leaders executed.
In a manuscript list of persons who were either openly engaged, or who
were vehemently suspected of being favorers of the design, I find in the latter
class the name of Capt. John Jossline.” This plot was not discovered till January,
1664; and our John Josselyn “departed from London,” as he says at page one of
this volume, “upon an invitation of my only brother,” the 28th of May of the
year previous. But, if it be possible that our author was the person intended in
the manuscript list as one strongly suspected of being engaged in a design against
the Royal Government, the evident uncertainty of this is too great to permit us
to discredit his own exposure of his political leanings,—as in the Voyages, p.
197, where, speaking of Sir F. Gorges, he says, “And, when he was between
three and fourscore years of age, did personally engage in our royal martyr’s
service, and particularly in the siege of Bristow; and was plundered and imprisoned
several times, by reason whereof he was discountenanced by the pretended
Commissioners for Forraign Plantations,” and so forth,—or in the face
of another passage to be quoted further on, in which he acknowledges “the
bounty of his royal sovereigness,” to question the sincerity—which there is
nothing in either of his books to throw doubt upon—of his general adhesion to
the Royalist side. “The family in Hertfordshire,” says Mr. Hunter, “were nonconformists;
but the spirit of nonconformity seems to have spent itself at the
death of Sir Strange Jocelyn, the second baronet, who died in 1734. But we may
trace the Puritan influence in the present Earl of Roden, who is a conspicuous
member of the religious body in England called the Evangelical.”—Ms. <i lang="la">ut sup.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> And see the Voyages, p. 187, for an account of a “Barbarie-Moor under
cure” of the author, when he “perceived that the Moor had one skin more than
Englishmen. The skin that is basted to the flesh is bloudy, and of the same
Azure colour with the veins, but deeper than the colour of our Europeans’ veins.
Over this is an other skin, of a tawny colour, and upon that [the] <i>Epidermis</i>, or
<i>Cuticula</i>,—the flower of the skin, which is that Snake’s cast; and this is tawny
also. The colour of the blew skin mingling with the tawny, makes them appear
black.” Dr. Mitchell, the botanist of Virginia, has a paper upon the same topic,—the
cause of the negro’s color,—in the Philosophical Transactions; but this
appears less in accordance with more recent researches (Prichard, Nat. Hist. of
Man, p. 81) than Josselyn’s observations.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">[12]</a> He is called <i>Botanicus Regius</i> by Cornuti, p. 22; and the same title is given
to both the Robins, in the printed catalogue of plants cultivated by them.
Tournefort indicates the office of Vespasian Robin, at the new Botanic Garden,
as follows: “<span lang="la"><i>Brossæus</i> ... primus Horti præfectus, studiosis plantas indigitandi
numeri præposuit Vespasianum Robinum diligentissimum Botanicum.</span>”—<cite>Inst.
Rei Herb.</cite>, vol. i. p. 48. And the recent writer in the Biographic Universelle,
says, more expressly, that the royal <em>ordonnance</em> establishing the garden names
Vespasian Robin “sub-demonstrator” of botany, with a stipend of two hundred
francs yearly. According to this writer, the two Robins were not, as has been
said, father and son, but brothers; and Vespasian the elder. This one must have
reached a great age, as the celebrated Morrison, who visited France in 1640, and
remained there twelve years, calls himself his disciple.—<cite>Biog. Universelle</cite>, <i lang="la">in

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">[15]</a> Mention of New-England plants may be found in earlier writers than Cornuti
or Josselyn; but what is said is now rarely available. Gosnold’s expedition
was in 1602; and the writer of the account of it tells us that the island upon
which his party proposed to settle (Cuttyhunk, one of the Elizabeth Islands) was
covered with “oaks, ashes, beech, walnut, witch-hazel, sassafrage, and cedars,
with divers others of unknown names;” beside “wild pease, young sassafrage,
cherry-trees, vines, eglantine, gooseberry-bushes, hawthorn, honeysuckles, with
others of the like quality;” as also “strawberries, rasps, ground-nuts, alexander,
surrin, tansy, &amp;c., without count.”—<cite>Mass. Hist. Coll.</cite>, vol. xxviii. p. 76. And so
the writer of Mourt’s Relation, in 1620, speaks of “sorrel, yarrow, carvel, brook-lime,
liverwort, watercresses, &amp;c.”, as noticed, “in winter,” however, at Plymouth.—<cite>Hist.
Coll.</cite> vol. viii. p. 221. There is much here which is true enough, though
the “eglantine” of the first writer is an evident mistake, as doubtless also the
“carvel” of the other; but we have no reason to suppose that either of these
passages ever had any scientific value. Josselyn, so far as his Botany goes, does
not belong to this class of writers. There are important parts of his account of
our plants, in which we know with certainty what he intended to tell us; and,
farther, that this was worth the telling. And the credit which fairly belongs to
the new <i>genera</i> of American plants, in some sort indicated by him, shall illustrate
as well those other portions of his work where what he meant is a matter
rather of deduction from his particulars, such as they are, in the light of his only
here-and-there-cited authorities, than of plain fact. His English names—common,
and perhaps often indefinite, as they strike us—had more of scientific
value, in botanical hands at least, when he wrote, than now; and, there is good
reason to suppose, were meant to indicate that the plants intended, or in some
cases the <i>genera</i> to which they belonged, were the same with those published,
under the same names, by Gerard, Johnson, and Parkinson.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="label">[25]</a> The late Dr. Waterhouse, Professor of Medicine at Cambridge, read lectures
on Natural History to his classes as early as 1788, and published the botanical
part of these lectures in the Monthly Anthology, 1804-8; reprinting this in 1811,
with the title of the Botanist (Boston, 8vo, pp. 228). In the preface to this volume,
the author’s are claimed to have been the first public lectures on Natural
History given in the United States. The Massachusetts Professorship of Botany
and Entomology was founded in 1805, and the Botanical Garden in 1807; but the
eminent naturalist who first filled the chair left little behind him to bear witness
to his acknowledged “learning and genius.”—<cite>Quincy, Hist. Harv. Univ.</cite>, vol. ii.
p. 330. The studies of Peck were not, however, confined to the <i>Fauna</i> and
<i>Flora</i> of New England; and his distinguished successors in the lecture-room
and the botanical garden—Mr. Nuttall, the late Dr. Harris, and Professor Gray—may
be said to have maintained a like general, rather than local character, in
the entomological and botanical investigations pursued at the University.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">[26]</a> This house was one Mr. Robert Gibbs’s “of an ancient family in Devonshire,”
says Farmer (Geneal. Reg., p. 120); and it stood on Fort Hill, the way
leading to it becoming afterwards known as Gibbs’s Lane, and a wharf at the
waterside, belonging to the property, as Gibbs’s Wharf. Mr. W. B. Trask, who
obligingly examined for me the early deeds concerning this estate in Suffolk
Registry, furnishes a <i lang="la">memorandum</i>, that on the 6th June, 1671, Robert Gibbs of
Boston, merchant, conveys to Edward and Elisha Hutchinson, in trust, for Elizabeth,
wife of said Robert, during her life, and after her decease to such child or
children as he shall have by her, his land and house on Fort Hill, with warehouse
on wharf, ‘which land was formerly my grandfather, Henry Webb’s.’ The wife
of said Robert Gibbs was daughter to Jacob Sheafe by Margaret, daughter to
Henry Webb, mercer. Sampson Sheafe, a Provincial councillor of New Hampshire,
and the ancestor of a family of long standing there, married another daughter of
Jacob Sheafe. Mr. Gibbs was father to the Rev. Henry Gibbs, minister of Watertown,
and had other children; and the family continues to this day.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="label">[28]</a> Mr. Henry Josselyn was probably living at Black Point in 1638, when his
brother first visited it (Voyages, p. 20). It was then the estate (by grant from
the council at Plymouth) and residence of Captain Thomas Cammock; but he,
dying in 1643, bequeathed it, except five hundred acres which were reserved to his
wife, to Josselyn, who, marrying the widow, succeeded to the whole property,
which was described as containing fifteen hundred acres (Willis <i lang="la">infra</i>), but is
called by Sullivan five thousand (History of Maine, p. 128). In 1658, this and
other adjoining tracts were erected into a town by Massachusetts, under the name
of Scarborough, which is thus further noticed by our author in his Voyages, p.
201, as “the town of Black Point, consisting of about fifty dwelling-houses, and a
Magazine, or <em>Doganne</em>, scatteringly built. They have store of neat and horses,
of sheep near upon seven or eight hundred, much arable and marsh, salt and
fresh, and a corn-mill.”—Comp. Williamson’s Hist. of Maine, vol. i. pp. 392,

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_31" href="#FNanchor_31" class="label">[31]</a> The earliest ascents of the White Mountains were those made by Field and
others in 1642, of which we have some account in Winthrop’s Journal (by Savage,
edit. 1, vol. ii. pp. 67, 89). Darby Field, “an Irishman living about Pascataquack,”
has the honor of being the first European who set foot upon the summit
of Mount Washington. He appears at Exeter in 1639, and was at Dover in 1645,
and died there in 1649, leaving a widow, and, it is said, children (A. H. Quint,
N. E. Geneal. Reg., vol. vi. p. 38). It seems likely, from his account, that Field,
on reaching the Indian town in the Saco Valley, “at the foot of the hill” where
the “two branches of Saco river met,” pursued his way up the valley either of
Rocky Branch or of Ellis River, till he gradually attained to the region of dwarf
firs, on what is known as Boott’s Spur, which is between the “valley” called
Oakes’s Gulf, in which the “Mount Washington” branch of the Saco has its
head, and the valley in which the Rocky Branch rises (see G. P. Bond’s Map of
the White Mountains). There is no other way that shall fulfil the conditions
of the narrative except that over Boott’s Spur; but of the three streams, that is,
“the two branches of Saco River,” which come together at or near the probable
site of the Indian town, the Rocky Branch is the shortest, and its valley the most
ascending. Field repeated his visit, with some others, “about a month after;”
and later, in the same year, the mountains were visited by the worshipful Thomas
Gorges, Esq., Deputy-Governor, and Richard Vines, Esq., Councillor of the Province
of Maine, of which Winthrop takes notice at p. 89. Whether Josselyn
went up himself, or had his account from others, does not appear. But his calling
the mountains “inaccessible but by the gullies,” leaves it at least supposable,
that he, or the party from which he got his information (perhaps Gorges’s),
instead of gradually ascending the long ridges, or spurs, penetrated into one of
the gulfs (as they are there called), or ravines, of the eastern side; the walls of
which are exceedingly steep, and literally inaccessible in many parts, except by
the gullies. The “large level or plain of a day’s journey over, whereon grows
nothing but moss,” is noticed in Winthrop’s account of Gorges’s ascent, but not
in that of Field’s; and this plain—which doubtless includes what has since been
called “Bigelow’s Lawn” (lying immediately under the south-eastern side of the
summit of Mount Washington), but understood also, in Gorges’s account, to extend
northward as far as the “Lake of the Clouds”—furnishes another ground
for supposing that the last-mentioned explorer, or, at least, Josselyn, may have
penetrated the mountain by one of its eastern ravines; several of which head in
the great plain mentioned, while that is rather remote from what we have taken
for Field’s “ridge.” Our author is the only authority for the “pond of clear
water in the midst of” the top of Mount Washington; though a somewhat capacious
spring, which was well known there before the putting-up of the house on
the summit, may have been larger once; or he may rather have mistaken, or
misremembered, the position of the Lake of the Clouds.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_36" href="#FNanchor_36" class="label">[36]</a> “The pilhannaw is the king of birds of prey in New England. Some take
him to be a kind of eagle; others for the Indian ruck,—the biggest bird that is,
except the ostrich. One Mr. Hilton, living at Pascataway, had the hap to kill
one of them. Being by the sea-side, he perceived a great shadow over his head,
the sun shining out clear. Casting up his eyes, he saw a monstrous bird soaring
aloft in the air; and, of a sudden, all the ducks and geese (there being then a
great many) dived under water, nothing of them appearing but their heads. Mr.
Hilton, having made readie his piece, shot and brought her down to the ground.
How he disposed of her, I know not; but had he taken her alive, and sent her
over into England, neither Bartholomew nor Sturbridge Fair could have produced
such another sight.”—<cite>Josselyn’s Voyages</cite>, p. 95. These notices have been taken
to be sufficient by some writers to show the probable existence of “a bird of prey,
very large and bold, on the back of some of our American plantations.” But our
author’s account indicates clearly a crested eagle, which we cannot explain by
any thing nearer home than the yzquautli, or crested vulture of Mexico and the
countries south of it (<i>Falco Harpyja</i>, Gmel.); two notices of which (cited by
Linnæus) had been published some twenty years before Josselyn wrote, and may
have been supposed by him to be applicable to a large bird which he had heard
of as inhabiting mountains about Ossipee. The great heron—an inhabitant of
the coast, and so uncommon inland that “one ... shot in the upper parts
of New Hampshire was described to” Wilson “as a great curiosity” (Amer.
Ornith., by Brewer, p. 555)—has the size and the crest of Josselyn’s bird; and,
if this last was only (as is possible) the name of a confused conception made up
from several accounts of large birds, the heron may well be thought to have had
a share in it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_37" href="#FNanchor_37" class="label">[37]</a> “Of these, sometimes there will be forty, threescore and a hundred, of a
flock; sometimes more, and sometimes less. Their feeding is acorns, hawes,
and berries: some of them get a haunt to frequent English corn. In winter,
when the snow covers the ground, they resort to the seashore to look for shrimps,
and such small fishes, at low tides. Such as love turkey-hunting must follow it
in winter, after a new-fallen snow, when he may follow them by their tracks.
Some have killed ten or a dozen in half a day. If they can be found towards an
evening, and watched where they perch,—if one come about ten or eleven of the
clock,—he may shoot as often as he will: they will sit, unless they be slenderly
wounded. These turkies remain all the year long. The price of a good turkey-cock
is four shillings; and he is well worth it, for he may be in weight forty
pounds; a hen, two shillings.”—<cite>Wood</cite>, <cite>N. Eng. Prospect</cite>, chap. viii. See also
Josselyn’s Voyages, p. 99.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_38" href="#FNanchor_38" class="label">[38]</a> “The geese of the country be of three sorts. First, a brant goose; which is
a goose almost like the wild goose in England. The price of one of these is sixpence.
The second kind is a white goose, almost as big as an English tame
goose. These come in great flocks about Michaelmas: sometimes there will be
two or three thousand in a flock. Those continue six weeks, and so fly to the
southward; returning in March, and staying six weeks more, returning to
the northward. The price of one of these is eightpence. The third kind of
geese is a great grey goose, with a black neck, and a black and white head;
strong of flight: and these be a great deal bigger than the ordinary geese of
England; some very fat, and, in the spring, full of feathers, that the shot can
scarce pierce them. Most of these geese remain with us from Michaelmas to
April. They feed in the sea upon grass in the bays at low water, and gravel, and
in the woods of acorns; having, as other fowl have, their pass and repass to the
northward and southward. The accurate marksmen kill of these both flying and
sitting. The price of a grey goose is eighteen-pence.”—<cite>Wood</cite>, <cite>N. E. Prospect</cite>,
<em>l. c.</em> The white goose here mentioned is probably the snow-goose; upon which
compare Nuttall, Mass. Ornith., Water-Birds, p. 344. Josselyn (Voyages, p. 100)
says the brant and the gray goose “are best meat; the white are lean and tough,
and live a long time; whereupon the proverb, ‘Older than a white goose:’”
which is not supported by Wood or later writers. The snow-goose has become
much less frequent with us since the settlement of the country. The great grey
goose of Wood is our well-known Canada goose.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_39" href="#FNanchor_39" class="label">[39]</a> This was the best that our author could say of the eagles of New England.
Wood assists us once more here: “The eagles of the country be of two sorts,—one
like the eagles that be in England; the other is something bigger, with a
great white head and white tail. These be commonly called gripes.”—<cite>New-Eng.
Prospect</cite>, <em>l. c.</em> The first spoken of by Wood—and perhaps, also, what Josselyn
names last—may be the common or ring-tailed eagle, now known to be the
young of the golden eagle. The second of Wood, and first of our author, is
without doubt, the bald eagle; the (so to say) tyrannical habits of which bird
are sufficiently well known, at least in the vivid pages of Wilson. See the
Voyages, p. 96; where we learn also that “hawkes there are of several kinds; as
goshawks, falcons, laniers, sparrow-hawkes, and a little black hawke highly
prized by the Indians, who wear them on their heads, and is accounted of worth
sufficient to ransom a sagamour. They are so strangely couragious and hardie
that nothing flyeth in the air that they will not bind with. I have seen them
tower so high, that they have been so small that scarcely could they be taken by
the eye” (p. 95-6). Wood makes like mention of this little black hawk (New-Eng.
Prospect, <em>l. c.</em>); and R. Williams (Key into the Language of the Indians of
N. E., in Hist. Coll., vol. iii. p. 220) calls it “sachim, a little bird about the bigness
of a swallow, or less; to which the Indians give that name, because of its
sachem or prince-like courage and command over greater birds: that a man shall
often see this small bird pursue and vanquish and put to flight the crow and
other birds far bigger than itself.” This was our well-known king-bird; and
Josselyn, on the same page, tells us of “a small ash-colour bird that is shaped
like a hawke, with talons and beak, that falleth upon crowes; mounting up into
the air after them, and will beat them till they make them cry:” which was, perhaps,
the king-bird’s half-cousin, as Wilson calls him,—the purple-martin.</p>

diver is called cobble in England. Our author elsewhere (Voyages, p.

distinct; but <em>his</em> wilmot was “a kind of teal.”</p>

partridge, with ears” (<em>l. c.</em>); and the third, the Acadian or little owl. There are
but two owls reckoned in New-England’s Prospect; the second of which—“a
great owl, almost as big as an eagle; his body being as good meat as a partridge”
(<em>l. c.</em>)—is, perhaps, the snowy owl, which, according to Audubon, is good eating.—<cite>Peabody

go in flocks, and are good meat.... Thrushes, with red breasts, which

singing-birds; ninmurders, little yellow birds; New-England nightingales, painted
with orient colours,—black, white, blew, yellow, green, and scarlet,—and
sing sweetly; wood-larks, wrens, swallows, who will sit upon trees; and starlings,
black as ravens, with scarlet pinions. Other sorts of birds there are; as the troculus,
wagtail or dish-water, which is here of a brown colour; titmouse,—two
or three sorts; the dunneck or hedge-sparrow, who is starke naked in his winter
nest; the golden or yellow hammer,—a bird about the bigness of a thrush, that
is all over as red as bloud; woodpeckers of two or three sorts, gloriously set out
with variety of glittering colours; the colibry, viemalin, or rising or walking-bird,
an emblem of the resurrection, and the wonder of little birds. The water-fowl
are these that follow: Hookers, or wild swans; cranes; ... four sorts of
ducks,—a black duck, a brown duck like our wild ducks, a grey duck, and a
great black and white duck. These frequent rivers and ponds. But, of ducks,
there be many more sorts; as hounds, old wives, murres, doies, shell-drakes,
shoulers or shoflers, widgeons, simps, teal, blew-wing’d and green-wing’d didapers
or dipchicks, fenduck, duckers or moorhens, coots, pochards (a water-fowl like a
duck), plungeons (a kind of water-fowl, with a long, reddish bill), puets, plovers,
smethes, wilmotes (a kind of teal), godwits, humilities, knotes, red-shankes, ...
gulls, white gulls or sea-cobbs, caudemandies, herons, grey bitterns, ox-eyes, birds
called oxen and keen, petterels, king’s fishers, ... little birds that frequent the
sea-shore in flocks, called sanderlins. They are about the bigness of a sparrow,
and, in the fall of the leaf, will be all fat. When I was first in the countrie” (that
is, in 1638; in which connection, what follows is not without its interest to us),
“the English cut them into small pieces to put into their puddings, instead of
suet. I have known twelve-score and above killed at two shots.... The cormorant,
shape or sharke” (pp. 99-103).</p>

Richardson, in Sabine’s Appendix to Franklin’s Narrative of a Journey to the

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_56" href="#FNanchor_56" class="label">[56]</a> Wood (N. E. Prospect, <em>l. c.</em>) has but two kinds of deer: of which the first is
the moose; and the second, called “ordinary deer,” and, in the vocabulary of
Indian words, <em>ottuck</em> (compare <em>attuck</em> or <em>noonatch</em>, deer,—R. Williams, <em>l. c.</em>;
but <em>atteyk</em>, in the Cree dialect, signifies a small sort of rein-deer,—Richardson,
in Appendix to Franklin’s Journey, p. 665; and it is observable that Rasles’ word
for <em>chevreuil</em> is <em>norke</em>), is our American fallow-deer. R. Williams also appears
to distinguish with clearness but two; which are, perhaps, the same as Wood’s.
Josselyn, in this book, passes quite over the common, or fallow-deer: but, making
up in the Voyages for the fallings-short of the Rarities, he goes, in the former,
quite the other way; reckoning the roe, buck, red deer, rein-deer, elk, <em>maurouse</em>,
and <em>maccarib</em>. What is further said of these animals, where he speaks more at
large, makes it appear likely that the second, third, and fourth names, so far as
they have any value, belong to a single kind,—the “ordinary deer” of Wood
(whose description possibly helped Josselyn’s), or our fallow-deer; to which the
“roe” is also to be referred: and the “elk” he himself explains as the moose.
But, beside these two kinds, Josselyn has the merit of indicating, with some
distinctness, one, or possibly two, others,—the <em>maurouse</em> and the <em>maccarib</em>.
The <em>maurouse</em>—of which only the Voyages make mention—“is somewhat like
a moose; but his horns are but small, and himself about the size of a stag. These
are the deer that the flat-footed wolves hunt after.”—<cite>Voyages</cite>, p. 91. This is to
be compared with the <em>mauroos</em>, rendered “<em>cerf</em>,” of Rasles’ Dict., <em>l. c.</em>, p. 382;
and, in such connection, is hardly referable to other than the <em>caribou</em>, or rein-deer,—a
well-known inhabitant of the north-eastern parts of New England, and
likely, therefore, to have come to the knowledge of our author; while there seems
to be no testimony to its ever having occurred in Massachusetts and southward,
where Wood and Williams made their observations. The last, or the <em>maccarib</em>,
<em>caribo</em>, or <em>pohano</em>, of Josselyn, is described above; and, in the Voyages (p. 91),
he only repeats that it “is not found, that ever I heard yet, but upon Cape Sable,
near to the French plantations.” The “round” hoofs of the <em>maccarib</em> might lead
us to take this for the <em>caribou</em> of Maine; the round track of which differs much
from that of the fallow-deer. But the former is more likely to have been the
American elk; so rare, it should seem, where it occurred, when our author wrote,
and so little known in the New-England settlements, that his fancy, fed by darkling
hearsay, could deck it with the honors of the “unicorn.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_57" href="#FNanchor_57" class="label">[57]</a> “There are two or three kinds of them,—one a great yellow fox; another
grey, who will climb up into trees. The black fox is of much esteem.”—<cite>Josselyn’s
Voyages</cite>, p. 82; where is also an account of the way of hunting foxes in New
England. Wood has nothing special, but that some of the foxes “be black.
Their furrs is of much esteem” (<em>l. c.</em>) Williams (<em>l. c.</em>) has “<em>mishquashim</em>, a red
fox; <em>pequawus</em>, a gray fox. The Indians say they have black foxes, which they
have often seen, but never could take any of them. They say they are manittooes.”
Beside the common red fox, or <em>mishquashim</em>, we have in all these accounts—and
also in Morell’s <cite>Nova Anglia</cite>, <em>l. c.</em>, p. 129—mention of a black
fox; which may have been the true black or silver fox, or, in part at least, the
more common cross-fox (Aud. and Bachm., Viv. Quadr. N. A., p. 45); the pelt
of which is also in high esteem. For Williams’s gray fox, see the next note.
Josselyn’s climbing gray fox is perhaps the fisher (<i>Mustela Canadensis</i>, Schreb.),
notwithstanding the color. According to Audubon (<em>l. c.</em>, pp. 51, 310, 315), this is
called the black fox in New England and the northern counties of New York. I
have heard it more often called black cat in New Hampshire. But the true gray
fox (<i>Vulpes Virginianus</i>) “has, to a certain degree, the power of climbing trees.”

the gray squirril, and the flying-squirril (called by the Indian <em>assapanick</em>).” Our
author’s mouse-squirrel, which he describes, is the ground or striped squirrel:
probably the “<i>anequus</i>, a little coloured squirrel” of R. Williams, <em>l. c.</em>; and the
<em>anikoosess</em> (rendered <em>suisse</em>) of Rasles, <em>l. c.</em> The mattrise of our author is, according

with the mattrise, at least in size; and the name is perhaps comparable with

of our quadrupeds, mistakenly, the ferret; and R. Williams, the “<em>ockquutchaunnug</em>,—a
wild beast of a reddish hair, about the bigness of a pig, and rooting like

Indians generally over the country, winter and summer, delight in; and, at low
water, the women dig for them. This fish, and the natural liquor of it, they boil;
and it makes their broth and their nasaump (which is a kind of thickened broth)
and their bread seasonable and savoury, instead of salt.”—<cite>Williams’s Key, &amp;c.</cite>,
<em>l. c.</em> p. 224. “These fishes be in great plenty in most parts of the country: which
is a great commodity for the feeding of swine, both in winter and summer; for,
being once used to those places, they will repair to them as duly, every ebb, as if
they were driven to them by keepers.”—<cite>Wood</cite>, <cite>N. Eng. Prospect</cite>, <em>l. c.</em> The
mollusk thus approved is the common clam (<i>Mya arenaria</i>, L.); but the <em>poquauhock</em>,
or quahog (<i>Venus mercenaria</i>, L.), “which the Indians wade deep and dive
for” (R. Williams, <em>l. c.</em>, p. 224), was also eaten by them, and the black part of
the shell used for making their <em>suckauhock</em>, or black money. Wood speaks also
of “clams as big as a penny white loaf, which are great dainties amongst the
natives” (N. E. Prospect, <em>l. c.</em>); doubtless the giant clam (<i>Mactra solidissima</i>,

whistle like a bird; and, at the latter end of summer, croak like our English
frogs.”—<cite>N. Eng. Prospect</cite>, <em>l. c.</em> In his Voyages, Josselyn speaks (as Wood
had done) of the tree-toad, and also of another kind of toad; and of “the eft,
or swift, ... a most beautiful creature to look upon; being larger than ours,
and painted with glorious colours: but I lik’d him never the better for it” (p.
119).</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_104" href="#FNanchor_104" class="label">[104]</a> Wood’s account (New-Eng. Prospect, <em>l. c.</em>) is worth comparing with Higginson’s
(New-England’s Plantation, <em>l. c.</em>) and with Josselyn’s, both here and at pp.
23 and 114 of the Voyages. Wood justly says of this “most poisonous and dangerous
creature,” that it is “nothing so bad as the report goes of him.... He is
naturally,” he continues, “the most sleepy and unnimble creature that lives;
never offering to leap or bite any man, if he be not trodden on first: and it is
their desire, in hot weather, to lie in paths where the sun may shine on them;
where they will sleep so soundly, that I have known four men to stride over
them, and never awake her.... Five or six men,” he adds, “have been bitten
by them; which, by using of snake-weed” (compare the preface to this, p. 119),
“were all cured; never any yet losing his life by them. Cows have been bitten;
but, being cut in divers places, and this weed thrust into their flesh, were cured.
I never heard of any beast that was yet lost by any of them, saving one mare”
(<em>l. c.</em>). Of other serpents, Wood mentions the black snake; and Josselyn, in his
Voyages (<em>l. c.</em>), speaks of “infinite numbers, of various colours;” and especially
of “one sort that exceeds all the rest; and that is the checkquered snake, having
as many colours within the checkquers shadowing one another as there are in a
rainbow.” He says again, “The water-snake will be as big about the belly as the
calf of a man’s leg” which is, perhaps, the water-adder. Josselyn adds, “I never
heard of any mischief that snakes did” (<em>l. c.</em>); and so Wood: “Neither doth any
other kind of snakes” (the rattle-snake always excepted, as no doubt dangerous
when trodden on) “molest either man or beast.” There are perhaps no worse
prejudices in common life, than those which breed cruelty. In the Voyages (p.
23), our author makes mention “of a sea-serpent, or snake, that lay quoiled up
like a cable upon a rock at Cape Ann. A boat passing by with English aboard,
and two Indians, they would have shot the serpent: but the Indians disswaded
them; saying, that, if he were not kill’d outright, they would be all in danger of
their lives.” This was from “some neighbouring gentlemen in our house, who
came to welcome me into the countrey;” and it seems, that, “amongst variety of
discourse, they told me also of a young lyon (not long before) killed at Piscataway
by an Indian;” which, indeed, was possibly not without foundation. And
as to the serpent, compare a Report of a Committee of the Linnæan Society of
New England relative to a large marine animal, supposed to be a serpent, seen
near Cape Ann, Mass., in August, 1817 (Boston, 1817); which contains also a
full account of a smaller animal—supposed not to differ, even in species, from
the large—which was taken on the rocks of Cape Ann.—See also Storer, Report
on the Reptiles of Mass.; Supplement, p. 410.</p>

indicated in North America, and common also to Europe. There is no doubt of
the reference, taking Josselyn’s name to be meant for specific, and to refer to
Gerard’s first figure with the same name. But it is certainly possible that our
author had in view only a general reference to Gerard’s fourteenth chapter, “Of
Hedgehog Grasse,” which brings together plants of very different genera; and,
in this case, his name is of little account. Cutler (Account of Indig. Veg., <em>l. c.</em>,
1785) mentions three genera of <i>Cyperaceæ</i>, but not <i>Carex</i>; nor did he ever publish
that description of our true <i>Gramineæ</i> “and other native grasses,” which, he
says (<em>l. c.</em>, p. 407), “may be the subject of another paper.” The first edition of
Bigelow’s Florula Bostoniensis (1814) has seven species of <i>Carex</i>, which are increased
to seventeen in the second edition (1824); the list embracing the most
common and conspicuous forms. The genus has since been made an object of
special study, and the number of our species, in consequence, greatly increased.
A list of Carices of the neighborhood of Boston, published by the present writer
in 1841 (Hovey’s Mag. Hort.), gives forty-seven species; and Professor Dewey’s
Report on the Herbaceous Plants of Massachusetts, in 1840, reckons ninety-one
species within the limits of his work.</p>

that we have plants strictly common to American and European Floras, in which
the differences referable to difference of atmospheric and other like conditions are
either not apparent or of no account; and it is possible that there are yet other
species, now considered peculiar to America, which only differ from older European

is likewise black walnut, of precious use for tables, cabinets, and the like”
(<i>Juglans nigra</i>, L.). “The walnut-tree,” continues Josselyn, “is the toughest
wood in the countrie, and therefore made use of for hoops and bowes; there being
no yews there growing. In England, they made their bowes usually of witch-hasel”
(that is, witch-elm,—<i>Ulmus montana</i>, Bauh., Lindl.; as see Gerard, p.
1481: but <i>Carpinus</i>, “in Essex, is called witch-hasell,”—<em>ib.</em>), “ash, yew, the best
of outlandish elm; but the Indians make theirs of walnut.” This was hickory,
and what Wood says belongs doubtless to the same. He calls it “something
different from the English walnut; being a great deal more tough and more
serviceable, and altogether heavy. And whereas our guns, that are stocked with
English walnut, are soon broken and cracked in frost,—being a brittle wood,—we
are driven to stock them new with the country walnut, which will endure all
blows and weather; lasting time out of mind.” After speaking favorably of the
fruit, he adds (New-Eng. Prospect, chap. vi.), “There is likewise a tree, in some
parts of the country, that bears a nut as big as a pear,”—the butternut, doubtless
(<i>Juglans cinerea</i>, L.). Josselyn has told us (p. 48) of the oil which the Indians
managed to get from the acorns of the white oak. Roger Williams (Key, <em>l. c.</em>, p.
220) says our native Americans made “of these walnuts ... an excellent oil,
good for many uses, but especially for the anointing of their heads.” Michaux
(<cite>Sylva</cite>, vol. i. p. 163) says the Indians used the oil of the butternut, and also (p.
185) of the shag-bark, “to season their aliments.” Williams adds (<em>l. c.</em>), “Of the

the neighborhood of Boston,—long the only American station for it. There is a
tradition that it was introduced here by Gov. Endicott; which may have been
some forty years before Josselyn finished his herborizing,—enough to account for
its naturalization then. It was long confined to Salem (“pastures between New

on the shores of Cambridge Bay, and also on roadsides in Old Cambridge.

of plants, which we possess, common to the Old World. He tells us (New-England’s

requires so much pains in riving as is almost incredible; being the best to make
bowls and dishes, not being subject to crack or leak. This tree growing with
broad-spread arms, the vines twist their curling branches about them; which
vines afford great store of grapes,” &amp;c. This was our American hornbeam (<i>Carpinus

(New-England’s Plantation, <em>l. c.</em>, p. 118), “what great gaine some of our English
planters have had by our Indian corne. Credible persons have assured me,—and
the partie himselfe avouched the truth of it to me,—that, of the setting of
thirteen gallons of corne, hee hath had encrease of it 52 hogsheads; every hogshead
holding seven bushels, of London measure: and every bushell was by him
sold and trusted to the Indians for so much beaver as was worth 18 shillings.
And so, of this 13 gallons of corne, which was worth 6 shillings 8 pence, he made
about 327 pounds of it the yeere following, as by reckoning will appeare; where
you may see how God blessed husbandry in this land. There is not such greate
and plentifull eares of corne, I suppose, any where else to bee found but in this
countrey; because, also of varietie of colours,—as red, blew, and yellow, &amp;c.:
and of one corne there springeth four or five hundred.” Roger Williams (Key,
<em>l. c.</em>, pp. 208, 221) has some interesting particulars of the Indian use of their corn.
According to him, the Indian <em>msickquatash</em> (that is succotash, as we call it now)
was “boiled corn whole,” and <em>nawsaump</em>, a kind of meal pottage unparched.
From this the English call their samp; which is the Indian corn beaten and
boiled, and eaten, hot or cold; with milk or butter,—which are mercies beyond
the natives’ plain water, and which is a dish exceeding wholesome for the English
bodies.</p>

plant themselves, very frequently. Yet I never see any take so excessively as I
have seen men in Europe; and yet excess were more tolerable in them, because
they want the refreshing of beer and wine, which God had vouchsafed Europe.”—<cite>R.
Williams</cite>, <cite>Key</cite>, <em>l. c.</em>, p. 213. And, in another place, the same writer says that
tobacco is “commonly the only plant which men labour in” (he is speaking of
the Indians); “the women managing all the rest” (p. 208). Wood, in his list
of Indian words (New-Eng. Prospect, <i lang="la">ad ult.</i>), spells the Indian word, above
given, <em>ottommaocke</em>,—(perhaps both are comparable with “<em>wuttahimneash</em>,
strawberries” Williams, <em>l. c.</em>, p. 220), and “<em>weetimoquat</em>, it smells sweet”
(Vocab. of Narraganset Lang., in Hist. Coll., vol. v. p. 82); <em>og</em>, <em>ock</em>, and <em>ash</em>,
being all plural terminations; between which and “the noun in the singular one
or more consonants or vowels are frequently interspersed” (<em>ibid.</em>, vol. iii. p. 222,
note); and <em>oquat</em>, from the context, the verbal; and the root appearing possibly
the same,—and also defines it as tobacco. There is much other testimony that
the New-England savages were found using “tobacco” (as Mourt’s Relation, <em>l. c.</em>,
p. 230; and Winslow’s Relation, <em>l. c.</em>, p. 253); but our author’s text, above, appears
to distinguish the true herb, “not much planted,” from “a small kind
called <em>pooke</em>,” which “the Indians make use of.” And again, more clearly, in
his Voyages, we have to the same effect: “the Indians in New England use a
small, round-leafed tobacco, called by them or the fishermen <em>poke</em>. It is odious
to the English.... Of marchantable ... tobacco, ... there is little of it
planted in New England; neither have they” (both clauses appear to refer to the
English) “learned the right way of curing of it.” This “marchantable tobacco”
was no doubt mainly <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>, L.; but the other kind, the weak tobacco,—cultivated,
as Williams tells us, by the Indians, and recognized as
tobacco by the English,—was not, as Wood says (N. E. Prospect, <em>l. c.</em>), colt’s-foot,
but <i>Nicotiana rustica</i>, L. (the yellow henbane of Gerard’s Herbal, p. 356),
well known to have been long in cultivation among the American savages, and
now a naturalized relic of that cultivation in various parts of the United States.
The name, <em>poke</em>, or <em>pooke</em>,—if it be, as is supposable, the same with “<em>puck</em>,
smoke,” of the Narraganset vocabulary of R. Williams (Hist. Coll., vol. v. p. 84),—was
perhaps always indefinite, and, since Cutler’s day, has been applied in
New England to the green hellebore (<i>Veratrum viride</i>, Ait.); but this was not, it
is evident, the poke of the first settlers. The name is also given to <i>Phytolacca
decandra</i>, L. (the <em>skoke</em> of Cutler), and the hellebore apparently distinguished
from this as Indian poke; but the application of the name to the former, at least,
probably had its origin among the whites.</p>

adds the peculiar medicinal virtues of the plant, which are the same as those

England, says Johnson. The dried herb, used by the fishermen instead of tobacco,
and no doubt called by them <em>poke</em>, may have been mistaken by Wood for
colt’s-foot, the leaves of which were “smoked by the ancients in pulmonary complaints;

substituted for tobacco.”—<cite>Wood and Bache</cite>, <cite>Dispens.</cite>, p. 1401. <i>Cornus sericea</i>,

(the emetic-weed of Cutler, <em>l. c.</em>, p. 484; who “first attracted to it the attention

(Voyages, p. 130); and again, at p. 74 of the same, “The water-melon is proper
to the countrie. The flesh of it is of a flesh-colour; a rare cooler of feavers, and
excellent against the stone.” The water-melon (<i>Cucurbita citrullus</i>, L.) is “the
only medicine the common people use in ardent fevers,” in Egypt (Loudon, <em>l. c.</em>).
<i>Cucurbita pepo</i>, L. (Gr. πέπων; Low Dutch, <i>pepoen</i>, <i>pompoen</i>; Fr., <i>pompone</i>),
is our English pompion, or pumpkin. At p. 91, Josselyn speaks of pompions
“proper to the country.” Compare Gerard’s chapter “of melons, or pompions”
(Johnson’s Gerard, p. 918), where are two Virginian sorts; and see “the ancient
New-England standing dish,” <a href="#P91">at p. 91</a> of this book. The evidence appears to be
sufficient, that our savages had in cultivation, together with their corn and tobacco,—and,
like these, derived originally from tropical regions,—several sorts of
what we call squashes, some kinds of pompion, and also water-melons; and,
Graves’s letter (New-England Plantation, <em>l. c.</em>, p. 124) adds, musk-melons. See
further, especially, Champlain (Voy. de la Nouv. France, <i lang="la">passim</i>) and L’Escarbot
(Hist. de la Nouv. France, vol. ii. p. 836). Mr. A. De Candolle (Geogr. Bot.,
vol. ii. pp. 899, 904) disputes the American origin of the edible gourds, but does
not appear to have examined all the early authorities for their cultivation by the
savages before the settlement of this country. Such cultivation appears to be
made out, and to indicate that these vegetables have probably been known, from
very remote antiquity, in the warmer parts of America. But this does not touch
the difficult question of origin; and it may still appear that the gourds are equally
ancient in Europe, and derived, both here and there, from Asia (De Cand., <em>l. c.</em>);
such derivation being explainable, in the case of America, by old migrations from
Asia through Polynesia.—<cite>Pickering</cite>, <cite>Races of Man</cite>, chap. 17.</p>

was formerly much less thought of in England than was ours (according to Josselyn)

presumption that the names cited are meant to be accurate. Mr. A. De Candolle

for the naturalized plants of the Northern States earlier than the first edition of

<p><a id="Footnote_249" href="#FNanchor_249" class="label">[249]</a> “It is but one sort, and that is broad-leaved plantain” (Josselyn’s Voyages,
p. 188). Broad-leaved plantain (Gerard, p. 419),—<i>Plantago major</i>, L.; one of
the most anciently and widely known of plants, and inhabiting, at present, all the
great divisions of the earth. An account, similar to our author’s, of the name
given to it by the American savages, is found in Kalm’s Travels. “Mr. Bartram
had found this plant in many places on his travels; but he did not know whether
it was an original American plant, or whether the Europeans had brought it
over. This doubt had its rise from the savages (who always had an extensive
knowledge of the plants of the country) pretending that this plant never grew
here before the arrival of the Europeans. They therefore gave it a name which
signifies the Englishman’s foot; for they say, that, where a European had walked,
there this plant grew in his footsteps.”—<cite>Kalm’s Travels into North America</cite>, by
Forster, vol. i. p. 92. But Dr. Pickering considers it possible, that, in North-west
America at least, the plantain was introduced by the aborigines (Races of Man,
pp. 317, 320): and, uncertain as this is admitted to be, the old vulgar names of
the plant in Northern languages—as <i lang="de">Wegerich</i> and <i lang="de">Wegetritt</i> of the German,
<i lang="nl">Weegblad</i> and <i lang="nl">Weegbree</i> of the Dutch, <i lang="da">Veibred</i> of the Danish, and <i lang="ang">Weybred</i> of
old English, all pointing to the plantain’s growing on ways trodden by man—suggest,
perhaps, a far older supposed relation between this plant and the human
foot than that mentioned above; and thus favor the derivation of the original
Latin name (as old as Pliny, H. N., vol. xxv. 8, in § 39) from <i>planta</i>, the sole of the
foot,—whether because the plantain is always trodden on, or, taking the termination
<em>go</em> in <i>plantago</i>, as some philologists take it, to signify likeness (as doubtless
in <i>lappago</i>, <i>mollugo</i>, <i>asperugo</i>; but this signification does not appear so clear in
some other words with the like ending), because its leaves resemble the sole of
the foot in flatness, breadth, marking, and so on. The possible derivation from
planta, a plant, “<i lang="la">per excellentiam, quasi plantam præstantissimam</i>” (Tournef.,
Inst., vol. i. p. 128), though less open to question than that of Linnæus (“<i>planta
tangenda</i>,” Phil. Bot., § 234), is certainly less significant than the other; which,
with the statements (independent, so far as appears, of each other) of Josselyn
and Kalm, if these may be relied on, seems to point to a very ancient co-incidence
of thought, not unworthy of attention. Something else of the same sort is
to be found in R. Williams, where he says (Key, <em>l. c.</em>, p. 218) that the Massachusetts
Indians called the constellation of the Great Bear <em>mosk</em>, or <em>pawkunnawaw</em>;
that is, the bear.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_262" href="#FNanchor_262" class="label">[262]</a> The earliest, almost the only account that we have of the gardens of our
fathers, after they had settled themselves in their <em>New</em> England, and had tamed
its rugged coasts to obedience to English husbandry. What with their garden
beans, and Indian beans, and pease (“as good as ever I eat in England,” says
Higginson in 1629); their beets, parsnips, turnips, and carrots (“our turnips,
parsnips, and carrots are both bigger and sweeter than is ordinary to be found in
England,” says the same reverend writer); their cabbages and asparagus,—both
thriving, we are told, exceedingly; their radishes and lettuce; their sorrel, parsley,
chervil, and marigold, for pot-herbs; and their sage, thyme, savory of both
kinds, clary, anise, fennel, coriander, spearmint, and pennyroyal, for sweet herbs,—not
to mention the Indian pompions and melons and squanter-squashes, “and
other odde fruits of the country,”—the first-named of which had got to be so well
approved among the settlers, when Josselyn wrote in 1672, that what he calls
“the ancient New-England standing dish” (we may well call it so now!) was
made of them; and, finally, their pleasant, familiar flowers, lavender-cotton and
hollyhocks and satin (“we call this herbe, in Norfolke, sattin,” says Gerard;
“and, among our women, it is called honestie”) and gillyflowers, which meant
pinks as well, and dear English roses, and eglantine,—yes, possibly, hedges of
eglantine <a href="#P90">(p. 90 note)</a>,—surely the gardens of New England, fifty years after the
settlement of the country, were as well stocked as they were a hundred and fifty
years after. Nor were the first planters long behindhand in fruit. Even at his
first visit, in 1639, our author was treated with “half a score very fair pippins,”
from the Governor’s Island in Boston Harbor; though there was then, he says
(Voyages, p. 29), “not one apple tree nor pear planted yet in no part of the countrey
but upon that island.” But he has a much better account to give in 1671:
“The quinces, cherries, damsons, set the dames a work. Marmalad and preserved
damsons is to be met with in every house. Our fruit-trees prosper abundantly,—apple-trees,
pear-trees, quince-trees, cherry-trees, plum-trees, barberry-trees. I
have observed, with admiration, that the kernels sown, or the succors planted,
produce as fair and good fruit, without graffing, as the tree from whence they
were taken. The countrey is replenished with fair and large orchards. It was
affirmed by one Mr. Woolcut (a magistrate in Connecticut Colony), at the Captain’s
messe (of which I was), aboard the ship I came home in, that he made five
hundred hogsheads of syder out of his own orchard in one year.”—<cite>Voyages</cite>, p.
189-90. Our barberry-bushes, now so familiar inhabitants of the hedgerows of
Eastern New England, should seem from this to have come, with the eglantines,
from the gardens of the first settlers. Barberries “are planted in most of our
English gardens,” says Gerard.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_275" href="#FNanchor_275" class="label">[275]</a> Brier-rose, or hep-tree (Gerard, p. 1270); “also called <i>Rosa canina</i>, which
is a plant so common and well knowne, that it were to small purpose to use many
words in the description thereof: for even children with great delight eat the
berries thereof, when they be ripe,—make chaines and other prettie gewgawes
of the fruit; cookes and gentlewomen make tarts, and such like dishes, for pleasure
thereof,” &amp;c. (Gerard, <em>l. c.</em>). <i>Rosa canina</i>, L., was once the collective name
of what are now understood as many distinct species; but that which still retains
the name of dog-rose is reckoned the finest of native English roses. This familiar
plant may well have been reared with tender interest in some New-England gardens
of Josselyn’s day; but it did not make a new home here, like the eglantine.
Cutler gives the name of dog-rose to the Carolina rose,—<i>R. Carolina</i>, L.,—which
it has not kept; and he also makes it equivalent to the officinal <i>R. canina</i>.
Our Flora will possibly one day include one or two other garden-roses. A damask
rose is well established and spreading rapidly in mowing-land of the writer’s,
and elsewhere on roadsides of this country; and that general favorite, the cinnamon-rose,
which is now naturalized in England, may yet become wild with us.</p>

is, sight-wort—makes manifest; the juice being once thought to be
“good to sharpen the sight,”—<i>Chelidonium majus</i>, L. Small celandine (<i>Ranunculus
Ficaria</i>, L.) was quite another thing. The former had got to be “common
by fences and amongst rubbish” in 1785 (Cutler, <em>l. c.</em>), and is now naturalized in
Eastern New England.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_279" href="#FNanchor_279" class="label">[279]</a> “For such commodities as lie under ground, I cannot, out of mine own
experience or knowledge, say much; having taken no great notice of such things:
but it is certainly reported that there is iron-stone; and the Indians informed us
that they can lead us to the mountains of black-lead; and have shown us lead-ore,
if our small judgment in such things does not deceive us; and though nobody
dare confidently conclude, yet dare they not utterly deny, but that the Spaniard’s-bliss
may lie hid in the barren mountains. Such as have coasted the country
affirm that they know where to fetch sea-coal, if wood were scarce. There is
plenty of stone, both rough and smooth, useful for many things; with quarries of
slate, out of which they get coverings for houses; with good clay, whereof they
make tiles and bricks and pavements for their necessary uses. For the country
it is well watered as any land under the sun; every family, or every two families,
having a spring of sweet water betwixt them; which is far different from the waters
of England, being not so sharp, but of a fatter substance, and of a more jetty
colour.... Those that drink it be as healthful, fresh, and lusty as they that
drink beer.”—<cite>Wood, New-Eng. Prospect</cite>, chap. v. “The humour and justness
of” this writer’s “account recommend him,” says the editor of 1764, “to every
candid mind.” There is certainly no view of New England, as it was at its settlement,
that surpasses Wood’s in understanding, and homeborn English truth, not
always without beauty. What he says in this place of “quarries of slate” points
to a very early discovery. Higginson says, in 1629 (New-Eng. Plantation, <em>l. c.</em>,
p. 118), “Here is plenty of slates at the Isle of Slate in Masathulets Bay:”
and there is a court order of July 2, 1633, granting “to Tho: Lambe, of slate in
Slate Ileand, 10 poole towards the water-side, and 5 poole into the land, for three
yeares; payeing the yearely rent of ijs. vjd.”—<cite>Mass. Col. Rec.</cite>, vol. i. p. 106.
There are other later grants of the same island, which “lies between Bumkin
Island and Weymouth River.”—<cite>Pemberton, Desc. Bost., Mass. Hist. Coll.</cite>, vol.
iii. p. 297. Josselyn, in his Voyages, p. 46, says that tables of slate could be got
out (he does not tell us where), “long enough for a dozen men to sit at.” Argillaceous
slate is, according to Dr. Hitchcock, “the predominating rock on the
outermost of these islands;” and he adds, that “there can be but little doubt that
the peninsula of Boston has a foundation” of this rock.—<cite>Report on Geol. of
Mass.</cite>, p. 270.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_286" href="#FNanchor_286" class="label">[286]</a> The author has something to the same effect in his Voyages, p. 124; but
Wood’s account of the Indian women (New-England’s Prospect, part ii. chap.
xx.) is far better worth reading. Both appreciated, in one way or another, their
savage neighbors. Wood has a pleasant touch at the last. “These women,” he
says, “resort often to the English houses, where <i lang="la">pares cum paribus congregatæ</i>,—in
sex, I mean,—they do somewhat ease their misery by complaining, and
seldom part without a relief. If her husband come to seek for his squaw, and
begin to bluster, the English woman betakes her to her arms, which are the war-like
ladle and the scalding liquors, threatning blistering to the naked runaway,
who is soon expelled by such liquid comminations. In a word, to conclude this
woman’s history, their love to the English hath deserved no small esteem; ever
presenting them something that is either rare or desired,—as strawberries, hurtleberries,
rasberries, gooseberries, cherries, plumbs, fish, and other such gifts as
their poor treasury yields them” (<em>l. c.</em>). And, if Lechford’s Newes from New
England (<em>l. supra c.</em>, p. 103) can be trusted, the savages became “much the
kinder to their wives by the example of the English.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_287" href="#FNanchor_287" class="label">[287]</a> In the author’s Voyages, this chronological table is greatly extended; beginning

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_289" href="#FNanchor_289" class="label">[289]</a> The author, in the “chronological observations” appended to his Voyages,
enlarges this, but confounds Conant’s Plantation at Cape Ann, and Endicott’s,
as follows: “1628. Mr. John Endicot arrived in New England with some number
of people, and set down first by Cape Ann, at a place called afterwards Gloster;
but their abiding-place was at Salem, where they built the first town in
the Massachusets Patent.... 1629. Three ships arrived at Salem, bringing a
great number of passengers from England.... Mr. Endicot chosen Governour.”
The next year, Josselyn continues as follows: “1630. The 10th of July, John
Winthrop, Esq., and the Assistants, arrived in New England with the patent for
the Massachusetts.... John Winthrop, Esq., chosen Governour for the remainder
of the year; Mr. Thomas Dudley, Deputy-Governour; Mr. Simon Broadstreet,
Secretary.”—<cite>Voyages</cite>, p. 252. The title of Governor was used anciently, as it
still is elsewhere, in a looser sense than has been usual in New England; and
derived all the dignity that it had from the character and considerableness of the
government. Conant and Endicott were directors or governors of settlements in
the Massachusetts Bay before Winthrop’s arrival; but when the Massachusetts
Company in London proceeded, on the 20th October, 1629, to carry into effect
their resolution to transfer their government to this country,—and chose accordingly
Winthrop to be their Governor; Humphrey, their Deputy-Governor; and
Endicot and others, Assistants (Young, Chron. of Mass., p. 102),—the record
appears sufficient evidence that they had in view something quite different from
the fishing plantation which Conant had had charge of at Cape Ann, or the little
society (“in all, not much above fifty or sixty persons,” says White’s Relation in
Young, Chron., p. 13; which the editor, from Higginson’s narrative, raises to
“about a hundred”) “of which Master Endecott was sent out Governour”
(White, <em>l. c.</em>) at Naumkeak.</p>

been, not “two,” but “forty, yards square:” and we are farther told that “the
like accident fell out at Casco, one and twenty miles from it to the eastward,
much about the same time; and fish, in some ponds in the countrey, thrown up
dead upon the banks,—supposed likewise to be kill’d with mineral vapours.”
Hubbard (Hist. N.E., chap. 75) tells this, partly in the same words with the
account in the Voyages, and adds, “All the whole town of Wells are witnesses
of the truth of this relation; and many others have seen sundry of these clay
pellets, which the inhabitants have shown to their neighbours of other towns.”
And compare also the following, at p. 189 of the Voyages: “In 1669, the pond
that lyeth between Watertown and Cambridge cast its fish dead upon the shore;
forc’t by a mineral vapour, as was conjectured.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
